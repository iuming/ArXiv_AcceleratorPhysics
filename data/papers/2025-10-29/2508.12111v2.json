  "title": "CosmicWatch: The Desktop Muon Detector(v3X)",
  "abstract": "The CosmicWatch Desktop Muon Detector (v3X) is a compact, low-cost, and portable device designed for detecting ionizing radiation, including cosmic-ray muons. Building on previous iterations, the v3X introduces significant hardware and firmware improvements that enhance sensitivity, usability, and data acquisition capabilities. The detector integrates a plastic scintillator and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), custom designed electronics for signal processing, onboard data storage, OLED display, environmental sensors, and USB connectivity. With a total component cost under \\$100 and a build time suitable for high school students, the v3X is ideal for education, outreach, and introductory research applications in particle and astroparticle physics. This paper details the design, performance, and potential use cases of the v3X, supported by example measurements demonstrating its functionality.",
