  "title": "Electron Emissions and Hot spots in Dual-Phase LXe TPCs",
  "abstract": "Persistent photon and single-electron emissions - in the form of \"electron trains\" and localized \"hot spots\" - have been observed in multiple dual-phase liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. We show that these phenomena are naturally explained by photon-triggered single-electron emission from resistive mixed-oxide films on stainless-steel wires, which behave as leaky capacitors with long RC time constants at LXe temperature. Positive ions landing on these oxides can further enhance local fields and drive Malter-like electron emission. We outline the materials physics (Cr2O3 / Cr2O3-x / Cr(OH)3 mosaics), quantify expected time scales (~1 second under illumination), and demonstrate how small damaged regions with enhanced QE can produce persistent hot spots.",
