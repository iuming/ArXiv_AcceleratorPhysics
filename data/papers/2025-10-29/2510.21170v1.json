  "title": "Inhomogeneous mixing: From microscopic dynamics to mesoscopic staircases",
  "abstract": "Inhomogeneous mixing and the consequent mesoscopic layered structure have been observed in many physical systems, including magnetically confined fusion plasmas. Especially, in plasmas, mixing can be enhanced through turbulence spreading by intermittent coherent structures (blobs/voids), or suppressed due to the formation of transport barriers (sheared zonal flows). Interestingly, blobs/voids and zonal flows are not independent, and they can co-exist in a state of inhomogeneous mixing, often called the E x B staircase. In this paper, we first introduce recent experimental progress on the physics of blobs/voids: how turbulence spreading by blobs/voids occurs, the consequences of enhanced turbulence spreading for the power decay length, and the interaction between blobs/voids and zonal flows. Then, we provide a brief review of experimental results on staircases, or more generally layered mesoscopic transport barriers. Staircases are often elusive and different complementary methods have been utilized to identify them, but our understanding is still incomplete. This paper serves as an initial step toward applying insights gained from inhomogeneous mixing due to blobs/voids to the understanding of a staircase.",
