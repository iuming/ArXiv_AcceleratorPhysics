  "title": "Evaluation of SiC detector performances for energy and timing   measurements",
  "abstract": "The development of new detectors based on Silicon Carbide (SiC) is currently a topic of interest within the scientific community. The significant features of SiC make it highly promising for detecting charged particles, neutrons, and $\\gamma$/X radiation. In this framework, within the SAMOTHRACE (Sicilian Micro and Nano Technology Research and Innovation Center) ecosystem, an array of new-generation SiC detectors is under development, specifically designed for nuclear and medical investigations using radioactive ion beams. This paper describes the results obtained in the characterization of SiC prototypes regarding energy and timing measurements. A new method, based on coincidence data analysis, is employed to evaluate the timing performances of SiC detectors. The obtained results have been compared with tests performed using a micro-channel plate as a start detector reference for timing measurements.",
