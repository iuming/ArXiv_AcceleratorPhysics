  "title": "Neutron capture measurement of the 165Ho at the CSNS Backn facility in   the resonance energy region",
  "abstract": "The neutron capture yield of 165Ho have been measured at the Back-streaming White neutron beam line (Back-n) of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) using a 4{\\pi} BaF2 Gamma Total Absorption Facility (GTAF). The resonance shapes in the 1eV to 1.0keV region were analyzed with the Bayesian R-matrix code SAMMY. For 18 s-wave resonances below 100eV, the resonance energy ER, neutron width {\\Gamma}n, and radiative width {\\Gamma}{\\gamma} were extracted. The statistical analyses of the resonance parameters show that the nearest-neighbour level-spacing distribution follows a Wigner-Dyson form with mean spacing D0 = 4.53(3)eV,indicating chaotic compound-nucleus behaviour; Using the extracted parameters, the s-wave neutron strength function for 165Ho was derived to be 10-4S0 = 2.01(1), in excellent agreement with the values reported in both the Atlas of Neutron Resonances and ENDF/B-VIII.0 data.",
