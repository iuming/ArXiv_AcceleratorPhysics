  "title": "Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron   monochromator",
  "abstract": "Monochromators are an essential component in electron microscopy and spectroscopy for enhancing the spatial and energy resolution. However, its adoption in scanning electron microscopes remains limited because of its high cost and operational complexity. Through a thin-deflector analysis of an electrostatic homogeneous-field deflector, the extreme sensitivity of current monochromators to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections is demonstrated. These stringent alignment requirements for achieving optimal energy resolution often necessitate the use of additional correcting elements, adding to both cost and complexity. We demonstrate that the fringe-field deflector is instead less sensitive to these issues. Hence, a cost effective and simple monochromator design approach based on pure fringe fields is proposed. This monochromator does not need extra correcting elements and its optimal energy resolution is achieved by including momentary deceleration lenses surrounding the main deflector. This fully electrostatic design could be realized using MEMS technology, offering a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering beam energies.",
