  "title": "Vacuum Brazing",
  "abstract": "First, we describe vacuum brazing and vacuum soldering. Then, we demonstrate how vacuum assists in reducing specific metal oxides, significantly enhancing the wetting of the braze material. Examples of metal-to-metal brazing and soldering are provided. The brazing of large accelerating cavities, specifically Radio Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQ), is then explained in more detail to present a comprehensive procedure tailored for high-precision, large-scale assemblies. Finally, we discuss the process of brazing ceramics using both techniques: with metallisation and with active brazing alloy.",
