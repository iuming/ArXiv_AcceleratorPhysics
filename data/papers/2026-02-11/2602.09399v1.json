  "title": "Simulation of the Space-Charge-Limited Current Density for Time-Variant Pulsed Injection",
  "abstract": "Space-charge-limited (SCL) current density for time-invariant injection (under long-pulse condition) via the diode cathode is the maximum transportable density, while it can be leveraged higher when the injection pulselength becomes shorter than the transmit time for electrons (i.e., under short-pulse condition). However, both limits mentioned above apply for the time-invariant injection condition and the role of time-varying current density for injection remains elusive. In this paper, we numerically investigate the SCL electron flow with time-variant injection. Using particle-in-cell simulation, four different time-variant profiles for electron injection are enforced, and the maximum current densities are determined resulting from the space charge effect for various pulse lengths. We speculate that the time-variant density of injection via the diode cathode will contribute to transport enhancement in the short-pulse condition.",
