  "title": "Synchronization of Synchrotron Radiation Bursts during a spatio-temporal Instability in accelerator-Based source",
  "abstract": "Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in dynamical systems, occurring in a wide range of contexts such as mechanical, chemical, biological, and social systems. In this work, we explore a novel manifestation of synchronization in accelerator-based light sources, specifically in storage rings where relativistic electron bunches circulate and emit synchrotron radiation, used for user experiments. In such systems, a systematic spatio-temporal instability arises when the bunch contains a large number of electrons. This instability is characterized by the spontaneous formation of microstructures within the bunch, which appear with a bursting behavior. We demonstrate that these bursting events can be synchronized with an external sinusoidal signal by modulating the electric field in a radiofrequency (RF) cavity. This external modulation induces typical synchronization features such as Arnold tongues at fundamental, harmonic, and subharmonic frequencies of the natural bursting rate, as well as phase-slip phenomena near the synchronization threshold. The synchronization mechanism is analyzed using numerical simulations based on the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, and a proof-of-principle experiment is conducted at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility.",
