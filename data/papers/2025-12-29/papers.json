    "title": "AI-Enhanced Real-Time Wi-Fi Sensing Through Single Transceiver Pair",
    "abstract": "The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications. In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. Building on these insights, we developed a real-time, AI-based Wi-Fi sensing and visualization system using a single transceiver pair, and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization. The system operates in real time on commodity hardware, and experimental results confirm our theoretical findings.",

    "title": "Revealing the transient ionization dynamics and mode-coupling mechanisms of helicon discharge through a self-consistent multiphysics model",
    "abstract": "Helicon plasma sources play a central role in applications ranging from material treatment to space propulsion and fusion, yet the physical processes governing their ignition, transient ionization, and mode evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we develop a self-consistent, fully coupled multiphysics framework that integrates Maxwell equations, electron energy transport, drift-diffusion kinetics, and heavy-species chemistry to capture the complete spatiotemporal evolution of helicon discharges. The model reproduces experimental measurements across pressure, magnetic field, and frequency ranges, and reveals a previously unresolved transient ionization stage characterized by a rapid density rise within ~10-4 s, accompanied by a two-peak electron temperature structure that governs the formation of the dense plasma core. By tracking the RF power flow and field topology, we characterize the transient redistribution of RF energy during ignition. A short-lived phase of localized energy deposition accompanies the onset of ionization, followed by an evolution toward helicon-like field characteristics together with rapid density growth and profile restructuring. Systematic parametric scans further reveal the sensitivity of this mode-coupling process to gas pressure, magnetic field strength, and driving frequency. These results provide a unified picture of the ignition and mode-transition physics in helicon plasmas and establish a predictive tool for the design and optimization of RF plasma sources across space propulsion, manufacturing, and fusion technologies.",

    "title": "WST spectroscopic variability alerts: discovery space, data flow system requirements",
    "abstract": "The enormous multiplexity of the WST opens up the possibility to trigger alerts for variable objects - an option that has been reserved so far only for imaging surveys. WST can go further by detecting spectroscopic line profile and line strength variations. I review previous alert-issuing surveys that are limited to imaging, and describe some of the new research possibilities that this feature of the data flow system (DFS) would open up. The latter range from variability of emission line stars, such as Bes, WRs and LBVs to variability of active galaxies and quasars, including the so-called changing look objects that shift between Type 1 and Type 2. Furthermore, I describe the requirements that the WST DFS must meet to make this feasible. The most critical aspect is the rapid data processing for timely follow-up. Next, the alert system is tightly connected with the data reduction and archive, because it will need an extensive and continuously updated spectral reference database. The new spectra will have to be compared against these reference spectra to identify variations. The reference spectra can either be \"native\" from the WST itself or they can originate from other spectroscopic surveys. Two options for the DFS are considered: one is to conduct an automated search of the WST's own archive, and potentially of other spectroscopic archives and a second option is to allow the users to submit reference spectra on their own. The spectroscopic alert system will open up a completely new discovery space that is not accessible to the existing or planned near-future surveys. Finally, I discuss the advantages of moving the variability detection to physical parameters by modeling the observed and reference spectra and comparing the derived fitting parameters. This strategy offers a robust method for alert ranking.",

    "title": "Isotope Production in Muon-Catalyzed-Fusion Systems",
    "abstract": "Producing valuable isotopes with high-flux high-energy neutrons generated by muon-catalyzed fusion ($μ$CF) reactions could substantially improve the economic prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion. Because no external heating is required for $μ$CF, heat flux constraints are significantly relaxed compared with fusion systems requiring external heating. This could allow $μ$CF to attain much higher neutron flux without breaching material heat flux limits. If muon production rates can be increased, $μ$CF systems employing transmutation could be viable well before energy breakeven is possible. For $μ$CF systems transmuting valuable isotopes, the required number of catalyzed fusion events per muon and muon energy generation cost can be relaxed by several orders of magnitude relative to electricity-generating systems, making $μ$CF an attractive high-flux neutron source. We show an example $μ$CF system with a 10 gram ${}^{226}\\mathrm{Ra}$ feedstock and a steady-state muon rate of $10^{12}$ muons / second - roughly half a kilowatt of fusion power - could produce 20 mg of ${}^{225}\\mathrm{Ac}$ per year - comparable to 400 times global supply in 2024. As higher muon rate sources become available, many other radioisotope transmutation pathways become viable. These findings motivate the accelerated development of $μ$CF systems for neutron-driven isotope production far before net energy generation is possible.",

    "title": "A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Textbook Model",
    "abstract": "An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.   I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \\cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.",

    "title": "Proposal for energy modulation to demodulation in seeded free-electron lasers",
    "abstract": "Laser manipulation plays a critical role in precisely tailoring relativistic electron beams through energy modulation, enabling the generation of coherent, intense, and ultrashort radiation in accelerator-based light sources such as synchrotron radiation facilities and free-electron lasers (FELs). However, laser-induced energy modulation inevitably degrades electron beam quality by increasing energy spread. In this paper, a straightforward yet practical implementation method for verifying the electron beam demodulation process in seeded FELs is proposed. The method employs a dedicated demodulation undulator system, referred to as a demodulator, equipped with a phase shifter. Both one-dimensional analytical models and three-dimensional simulations demonstrate that introducing a $π$ phase shift in the demodulator enables simultaneous energy modulation and demodulation using only a single seed laser. Under optimized conditions with weak initial modulation, simulation results indicate that the energy modulation can be substantially reduced or nearly eliminated. With increasing laser intensity, the modulation amplitude is significantly suppressed by more than an order of magnitude, effectively mitigating energy spread degradation. The residual energy modulation can be characterized using complementary diagnostic techniques: the coherent undulator radiation method combined with the dispersion scan method. The proposed method is expected to enable precise control over electron beam energy modulation, potentially facilitating the development of high-repetition-rate, fully coherent X-ray sources with improved electron beam quality preservation.",

    "title": "Minijets and Broken Stationarity in a Blazar : Novel Insights into the Origin of $γ$-ray Variability in CTA 102",
    "abstract": "High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $γ$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.",

We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3σ$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$~yr and $0.66$~yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an overview of the impurity transport for three H-mode plasmas in the upcoming SPARC tokamak has been provided. The simulations have been performed within the ASTRA+STRAHL framework, using FACIT and TGLF-SAT2 to predict, respectively, neoclassical and turbulent core transport, while a neural network trained on EPED simulations has been employed to calculate the pedestal height and width self-consistently. A benchmark with previous simulations at constant impurity fraction has been provided for three H-modes, spanning different plasma current and magnetic field values. For a scenario, additional simulations have been performed to account for uncertainties in the modeling assumptions. The predictions are nearly insensitive to changes in the top of pedestal W concentrations. Varying the Ar pedestal concentration has shown a small effect on the impurity peaking and nearly constant fusion gain values, due to multiple effects on pedestal pressure, main ion dilution and density peaking. The inclusion of rotation in ASTRA simulations has shown minimal impact on confinement and impurity transport predictions. An exploratory study has been provided with a first set of simulations treating D and T separately, experiencing a maximum fusion power at 55-45% DT fuel composition, and an asymmetric distribution with respect to the D concentration. All the results, including sensitivity scans of toroidal velocity and ion temperature and density gradients, highlighted that turbulent impurity transport prevails on the neoclassical component, aligning with previous ITER predictions, and suggesting that next generation devices like SPARC, operating at low collisionality, will experience low W accumulation.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of an intense laser pulse with a solid target produces energetic proton and ion beams through the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism. Such beams are under active investigation for applications in proton beam therapy, materials modification, and nuclear and high-energy-density physics. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical effort, predictive correlations between laser and target parameters and the resulting ion-beam properties remain an open research question, owing to the intrinsically multiphysics and strongly coupled nature of laser-plasma interactions. Here, we employ our unified multiphysics model that reproduces laser-solid interaction dynamics with accuracy exceeding 95% over a broad range of short- and ultrashort-pulse conditions. Using this model, we derive statistically validated scaling laws and probability maps that correlate proton, carbon, and oxygen ion cutoff energies, beam divergences, and ionization states to a wide set of laser and target parameters, including pulse duration, laser power, laser beam spot, target thickness, prepulse-main pulse interval, contrast, laser wavelength, and polarization. Continuous beam properties (cutoff energies and beam divergences) are described using multivariate regression with cross-validation, while discrete ionization states are analyzed using classification and regression tree (CART) methods, enabling nonlinear and threshold-dependent behavior to be captured. The resulting scaling relations, contour maps, and box plots elucidate the coupled roles of laser pulse, and target geometry in governing TNSA ion acceleration and charge-state formation. These results provide a predictive and physically interpretable framework for understanding and optimizing laser-driven ion sources across a wide parameter space.",

    "abstract": "The determination of the direction of a stellar core collapse via its neutrino emission is crucial for the identification of the progenitor for a multimessenger follow-up. A highly effective method of reconstructing supernova directions within the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is introduced. The supernova neutrino pointing resolution is studied by simulating and reconstructing electron-neutrino charged-current absorption on 40Ar and elastic scattering of neutrinos on electrons. Procedures to reconstruct individual interactions, including a newly developed technique called ``brems flipping'', as well as the burst direction from an ensemble of interactions are described. Performance of the burst direction reconstruction is evaluated for supernovae happening at a distance of 10 kpc for a specific supernova burst flux model. The pointing resolution is found to be 3.4 degrees at 68% coverage for a perfect interaction-channel classification and a fiducial mass of 40 kton, and 6.6 degrees for a 10 kton fiducial mass respectively. Assuming a 4% rate of charged-current interactions being misidentified as elastic scattering, DUNE's burst pointing resolution is found to be 4.3 degrees (8.7 degrees) at 68% coverage.",

    "title": "Identification of tau leptons using a convolutional neural network with domain adaptation",
    "abstract": "A tau lepton identification algorithm, DeepTau, based on convolutional neural network techniques, has been developed in the CMS experiment to discriminate reconstructed hadronic decays of tau leptons ($τ_\\mathrm{h}$) from quark or gluon jets and electrons and muons that are misreconstructed as $τ_\\mathrm{h}$ candidates. The latest version of this algorithm, v2.5, includes domain adaptation by backpropagation, a technique that reduces discrepancies between collision data and simulation in the region with the highest purity of genuine $τ_\\mathrm{h}$ candidates. Additionally, a refined training workflow improves classification performance with respect to the previous version of the algorithm, with a reduction of 30$-$50% in the probability for quark and gluon jets to be misidentified as $τ_\\mathrm{h}$ candidates for given reconstruction and identification efficiencies. This paper presents the novel improvements introduced in the DeepTau algorithm and evaluates its performance in LHC proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 and 13.6 TeV collected in 2018 and 2022 with integrated luminosities of 60 and 35 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. Techniques to calibrate the performance of the $τ_\\mathrm{h}$ identification algorithm in simulation with respect to its measured performance in real data are presented, together with a subset of results among those measured for use in CMS physics analyses.",

In this work, a Low-Level RF system architecture combined with White Rabbit based timing system has been tested through a collaboration between KEK (Japan) and CNRS/IN2P3, IJClab (France). The setup combines a frequency standard generator, an IDROGEN carrier board with an embedded White Rabbit node, and SkyWorks synthesizers of different form factors to distribute phase-locked clock signals over telecommunication fiber.

    "title": "Operation of a tunable Power over Fiber system for light detectors down to 4.6 K",
    "abstract": "The Power over Fiber (PoF) technology delivers electrical power by transmitting laser light through a lightweight, non-conductive fiber optic cable to a remote photovoltaic optical converter, which in turn powers sensors or electrical devices. Among the several advantages offered by this solution are spark-free operation in the presence of electric fields, elimination of noise induced by power lines, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and high robustness in hostile environments. The R\\&D for the application of PoF in cryogenic environments started at FNAL and BNL (USA) in 2020 to power the Photon Detection System of the DUNE Vertical Drift module. This paper presents the results obtained in the framework of Cryo-PoF project where we developed a single-laser input line system to power an electronic amplifier and the photosensors at cryogenic temperatures. Unlike the DUNE solution, our system allows tuning of the photosensor bias by adjusting the input laser power. We also demonstrate the operation of the optical converter at temperatures down to 4.6 K, opening the possibility of using this technology in a much broader range of applications.",

    "title": "Quantum Origin of Classical Background Fields from Coherent States: A First-Principles Formulation in QED",
    "abstract": "Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field.   Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime.   Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches.   Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.",

We obtain that bulk viscosity can be many order of magnitude bigger than the shear viscosity. Our result for the relaxation time reveals that the Mandelstam-Leontovich approximation for the frequency dependence of the bulk viscosity is in practice an exact result for the cold plasmas. The illustrative numerical examples correspond to the plasma cocktail of the solar chromosphere at the height of the minimal polytropic index. The possible application for the acoustic heating of the inner solar atmosphere up to the transition region is shortly discussed together with the evaluation to confirm the theory by laboratory plasmas.",

    "title": "Electron spectral shape of the third-forbidden $β$-decay of $^{87}$Rb measured using a Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator",
    "abstract": "In recent years, interest in experimental studies of $β$-decay electron spectra -- often referred to as $β$ spectra -- has been growing. This is particularly true for $β$ transitions where the electron spectra are sensitive to the effective value of the weak axial coupling, $g_{\\rm A}$. Such measurements serve as important benchmarks for nuclear physics calculations and can also be used to characterize background in astroparticle physics experiments. In this work, a dedicated experiment has been carried out to investigate the spectral shape of the third-forbidden $^{87}$Rb $β$-decays, with the goal of estimating the effective $g_{\\rm A}$ value for this transition and of deriving the T$_{1/2}$ value. This was done by comparing the experimental spectral shape with the estimates from various phenomenological models. The $^{87}$Rb source was embedded directly within the detector material of a new Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator; the data taking was performed deep underground at Gran Sasso National Laboratory. The obtained experimental half-life value for the studied process is T$_{1/2} = 5.08(13) \\times$ 10$^{10}$ yr; while a $g_{\\rm A}$ value in the range 0.4 to 0.6 is obtained when accounting for uncertainties and depending on the model adopted as discussed in detail in the text.",

    "title": "The throttling refrigeration system for the large cooling power recovery of the PandaX-xT cryogenic distillation system for radon removal",
    "abstract": "In order to solve the continuous large cooling power supply problem (20 kW) for the radon-removal cryogenic distillation system, which operates at high liquid ffow rate of 856 kg/h (5 LPM) for the dark matter detector PandaX-xT of the next-generation, a throttling refrigeration system based on carbon tetraffuoride (R14) refrigerant for cooling power recovery is designed and developed. According to this system, the cooling power of the liquid xenon in the reboiler of 178K could be transferred to the product xenon cryostat to liquefy the gaseous product xenon by the R14 circulation, thus the liqueffed xenon could return to the detector with the same condition of which extracted from the detector to form a stable cooling cycle and prevent the instability of the detector. A research and development experiment is implemented to validate the feasibility of this large cooling recovery system, using the ethanol to simulate the liquid xenon. Experimental results show that the cooling power recovery of this system could achieve 17 kW with the efffciency of 76.5%, and the R14 ffow rate is 0.16 kg/s. This study realizes the online radon removal distillation with large ffow rate while eliminating the dependence of liquid nitrogen or cryocoolers, which means saving 2414 m3 liquid nitrogen per year or the power consumption of 230 kW. Furthermore, process simulation and optimization of the throttling refrigeration cycle is studied using Aspen Hysys to reveal the inffuences of the key parameters to the system, and the deviation between the simulation and experimental results is < 2.52%.",

    "title": "Spectroscopy of VUV luminescence in dual-phase xenon detectors",
    "abstract": "We present spectroscopic measurements of xenon luminescence in a time projection chamber operated in a dual-phase (liquid-gas) configuration. Thorium-228 $α$ decays excited the liquid, resulting in the formation of singlet and triplet excimers that emit vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) scintillation. Ionisation electrons were drifted to the liquid surface and extracted into the vapour, where they produced VUV electroluminescence. A time-resolved photon-counting technique was used to obtain the scintillation spectrum in the liquid, which exhibited a peak wavelength of $177.1\\pm0.1_\\mathrm{stat} \\pm0.1_\\mathrm{sys}\\,\\textrm{nm}$ and a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $11.3\\pm0.2_\\mathrm{stat} \\pm0.0_\\mathrm{sys}\\,\\textrm{nm}$. The data were also used to obtain distinct singlet and triplet emission models, with the singlet emission peaking $1.8\\pm0.3_{\\mathrm{stat}}\\pm 0.3_{\\mathrm{sys}}\\,\\textrm{nm}$ shorter than the triplet. The gas electroluminescence spectrum was obtained simultaneously, while under conditions of thermal equilibrium. It remained consistent across vapour pressures of $1.3$-$2.2\\,\\textrm{bar}$, with a peak of $173.28\\pm0.02_\\mathrm{stat} {_{-0.1}^{+0.2}}{}_\\mathrm{sys}\\,\\textrm{nm}$, a FWHM of $10.59\\pm0.03_\\mathrm{stat} {_{-0.2}^{+0.0}}{}_\\mathrm{sys}\\,\\textrm{nm}$, and a small short-wavelength tail that constitutes $(0.6\\pm0.1)$% of the total spectrum. These are the only spectroscopic measurements of liquid scintillation and gas electroluminescence acquired simultaneously to date, and the first such measurements of singlet and triplet emission in the liquid phase. They are important for precisely characterising dual-phase xenon detectors used to search for dark matter particle interactions and other rare events.",

    "abstract": "Determining the relationship between nanoflare energies and their delays is the key for understanding the physical mechanism of the events and the plasma response. Nanoflares analyzed in this study were generated self-consistently via prescribed photospheric motions in a 3D multi-strand simulation of a subset of active region magnetic flux. Energies and durations were quantified using three distinct methods. In this study, we investigated the correlation between nanoflare energies (E) and delays ($τ_D$) using two non-parametric, rank-based statistical tests. Across all methods, results consistently show little to no correlation. This is further supported by the distribution of the exponent $α$ in the assumed relation $E \\propto τ_D^α$, which peaks near zero, and by broad delay distributions within fixed energy bins. These findings are irrespective of whether delays are correlated with the energy of the preceding or subsequent event. They also hold for a subset of high-energy nanoflares. The absence of correlation suggests that nanoflare onset is not solely determined by a critical value of magnetic stress and may involve triggering by other events, perhaps related to a locally complex topology.",

    "title": "Calibration of an Irradiated Prototype for the EIC Zero-Degree Calorimeter",
    "abstract": "We study the response of a prototype Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detector to irradiation equivalent to 10$^{11}$ 1-MeV protons/cm$^2$, which matches the expected exposure after one year of operation at full nominal luminosity at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The prototype consists of 563 channels and represents about 10 percent of the final ZDC design in terms of both channel count and detector volume. It was irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with a dose equivalent to 10$^{11}$ protons/cm$^2$. We demonstrate that, despite significant radiation damage to the SiPMs and non-uniform degradation across the detector volume, the detector can be successfully calibrated on a channel-by-channel basis using cosmic-ray data. The damage profile, similar to what is expected in the experiment, varies by an order of magnitude or more across the detector. Even for the most heavily damaged channels, the signal-to-noise ratio for a MIP signal remains above 5. This study provides a realistic test of the system's performance under irradiation. It complements previous SiPM-specific irradiation studies and will inform the future operation of the ZDC and other detectors that use SiPM-on-tile technology.",

    "title": "Large volume 'chunk' lift out for 3D tomographic analysis using analytical plasma focussed ion beam -- scanning electron microscopy",
    "abstract": "Characterization of the structure and properties of materials in three dimensions, including grains and the residual pattern of deformation, provides necessary information required to guide materials design as well as support materials modelling efforts. In this work, we present an overview of site-specific large volume 'chunk' lift out and 3D serial sectioning of substantive volumes (e.g. 200 x 200 x 400 um3), where sectioning is optimized for 3D electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) based crystallographic analysis, using a plasma (Xe) focussed ion beam scanning electron microscope (plasma FIB-SEM) equipped to perform EBSD using a 'static' configuration (i.e. slicing and EBSD-mapping are performed without moving the sample). This workflow is demonstrated through the 3D plasma FIB-SEM based EBSD analysis of an indent made within a polycrystal of pure magnesium. The lift out approach is suitable for a wide range of materials, and we offer a step-by-step guide within the present work to provide opportunity for others to more easily enter this field and collect valuable data.",

    "title": "Design of a high-resolution ion pulse ionization chamber for 222Rn decays detection in air",
    "abstract": "Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that contributes significantly to human radiation exposure and must be controlled to avoid concentrations harmful to health.   The paper presents an impulse-proportional ionization chamber that is suitable for the direct measurement of low radon concentrations in ambient air and achieves spectroscopic resolutions of 2-3%.   This accuracy can be achieved through two novel principles. Firstly, the double-cylindrical, coaxial design of the IC allows for efficient, nearly complete detection of $α$-radiation. Secondly, a customized measurement method for spectroscopic evaluation was developed to discriminate between the proportions of 222Rn, 218Po, and 214Po and extract their concentrations. Particular attention was paid to the energy resolution of the detection system by suppressing the effects of acoustic and vibration noise on the detector's operation.   The high spectral resolution of the developed ionization chamber, with working volumes of 7.7l and 8.7l, enables measurements with uncertainties of less than 5\\% at 15-minute measurement times in ambient air with $50\\,\\mathrm{Bq/m^3}$ radon activity.",

    "title": "An Instrument for Physical Vapor Deposition onto Cryo-EM Samples for Microsecond Time-Resolved Cryo-EM",
    "abstract": "Laser flash melting and revitrification experiments have recently improved the time resolution of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to the microsecond timescale, making it fast enough to observe many of the protein motions that are associated with function. The technique has also opened up a new dimension for cryo-EM sample preparation, making it possible to deposit compounds onto a cryo-EM sample while it is frozen, so that upon flash melting, the embedded particles experience an altered environment. For example, we have recently shown that depositing ultrathin silicon dioxide membranes onto a cryo-EM sample causes particles to detach from the interface upon flash melting, removing preferred particle orientation. These experiments also point towards a new strategy for initiating protein dynamics in time resolved experiments by depositing reagents, which will then mix with the sample upon flash melting. Here, we describe an apparatus for physical vapor deposition of compounds onto cryo-EM samples, detailing its design and operation. As a demonstration, we determine that the minimum thickness of silicon dioxide sealing membranes in a laser flash melting experiment is just over two monolayers. We propose that our design can form the basis for an integrated platform for microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM experiments.",

    "abstract": "Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.",

    "title": "Machine Learning Optimization of BEGe Detector Event Selection in the VIP Experiment",
    "abstract": "The VIP collaboration operates a Broad Energy Germanium detector at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory to measure radiation in the few keV to 100 keV range, aiming to search for spontaneous collapse induced radiation and atomic transitions that violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Here we present a machine learning based upgrade for the BEGe detector using an event selection strategy aimed at improving the efficiency in detecting low energy events down to 10 keV. The method employs a denoising autoencoder to suppress electronic and microphonic noises and to reconstruct pulse shapes, followed by a convolutional neural network that classifies waveforms as normal single site or events with anomalies. The workflow was validated on a dataset comprising more than 20000 waveforms recorded in 2021. The classifier achieves a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.99 and an accuracy of 95 percent. Applying this procedure lowers the minimum detectable energy of the final spectrum to approximately 10 keV. It also yields a measurable enhancement in spectral quality, including an improvement of about 14 percent in the signal to background ratio and a reduction of the energy resolution for the characteristic Pb and Bi gamma lines. These developments enhance the sensitivity of the BEGe detector to rare low energy signals and provide a scalable framework for future precision tests of quantum foundations in low background environments.",

With this model, we are able to benchmark BIFROST with respect to expected intensity, $Q$- and energy-resolution. The simulations reproduce the expected resolution behavior and quantify effects that are difficult to capture analytically, including a wavelength-dependent edge enhancement arising from a combination of the long-pulsed source and the pulse-shaping chopper. Furthermore, we present an antiferromagnetic (AF) spin wave simulation, which we use to create realistic datasets at different instrument operation settings. Our virtual experiments focus on realistic dispersive dynamics and illustrate how the virtual experiment approach reveal resolution effects, not easily calculable via analytical models. This demonstrates the crucial role of numerical simulations in the planning of challenging experiments.",

    "abstract": "In both research and industrial settings, it is often necessary to expand the input/output channels of measurement instruments using relay-based multiplexer boards. In research activities in particular, the need for a highly flexible and easily configurable solution frequently leads to the development of customized systems. To address this challenge, we developed a system optimized for automated direct current (DC) measurements. The result is based on a 4x4 switching platform that simplifies measurement procedures that require instrument routing. The platform is based on a custom-designed circuit board controlled by a microcontroller. We selected bistable relays to guarantee contact stability after switching. We finally developed a system architecture that allows for straightforward expansion and scalability by connecting multiple platforms. We share both the hardware design source files and the firmware source code on GitHub with the open-source community. This work presents the design and development of the proposed system, followed by the performance evaluation. Finally, we present a test of our designed system applied to a specific case study: the DC analysis of complex resistive networks through multi-point resistance measurements using only a single voltmeter and current source.",

    "abstract": "Inverse Compton scattering is developing to be a promising method to generate coherent and tunable x-rays. In this paper we present a theoretical framework to describe an inverse Compton scattering x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between the electron and laser pulse. Importantly the divergence of a tightly focused laser pulse will have a significant impact of the number of scattered x-rays. The parameters of the interaction geometry are optimized for two specific cases: head-on scattering; and a grazing co-propagating interaction angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tight symmetrically focused laser pulse, that balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a grazing angle geometry an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 μm), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 μm). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\\&D facilities as part of a linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer, independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\\&D for advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals, early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the context of CLIC and ILC.",

    "title": "Applications of silicon carbide as window materials in atomic cells and atomic devices",
    "abstract": "Atomic cells made by anodically bonding silicon and borosilicate glasses are widely used in atomic devices.   One inherent problem in these cells is that the silicon material blocks beams with wavelengths shorter than   1000 nm, which limits available optical accesses when alkali metal atoms are involved. In this work, we   investigate the possibility of the silicon carbide material as an alternative of silicon materials in fabricating   anodically bonded cells. We demonstrate that the optical, thermal and mechanical properties of silicon carbide   help to improve the performance of atomic devices in certain applications.",

    "title": "Thermal wakefield structure in plasma acceleration processes: insights from fluid models and PIC simulations",
    "abstract": "We focus on the process of plasma acceleration in the presence of non-negligible thermal effects, wherein a driver of relativistic electrons perturbs a warm neutral plasma and generates a wakefield structure. We study the acceleration process via numerical simulations based on fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions, and also provide systematic comparisons against ground-truth data coming from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The focus of the analysis is on the first electron depletion bubble after the driver, where we provide a detailed characterization of its size and the electromagnetic fields developed inside. Our results are instrumental in determining the correct thermal closure assumption to be used in fluid models for the numerical simulations of plasma acceleration processes, as well as elucidating the corresponding limits of applicability.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a comprehensive characterization of the FERS 5202 front-end readout unit when processing signals from Silicon Photo-multipliers (SiPMs). The readout system's performance is characterized in terms of its charge resolution, dynamic range, and noise performance at the single photoelectron level, which is critical for applications requiring detection of low-light signals such as medical imaging, high-energy physics experiments and photon counting applications. The evaluation encompassed both fundamental performance metrics and practical implementation scenarios using Hamamatsu MPPC devices. This work aims to provide valuable reference data not only for our intended muon radiography application but also for the broader scientific community employing SiPMs in diverse experimental contexts.",

    "title": "Precision Bounds for Characterising Quantum Measurements",
    "abstract": "Quantum measurements, alongside quantum states and processes, form a cornerstone of quantum information processing. However, unlike states and processes, their efficient characterisation remains relatively unexplored. We resolve this asymmetry by introducing a comprehensive framework for efficient detector estimation that reveals the fundamental limits to extractable parameter information and errors arising in detector analysis - the \\emph{detector quantum Fisher information}. Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements.",

    "title": "Verification of the Outer Space Treaty with Cosmic Protons",
    "abstract": "The Outer Space Treaty (OST) was opened to signatures in 1967, and since then 117 countries, including China, the United States, Russia, have become part of it. Among other stipulations the treaty bans the placement of nuclear weapons in outer space. Recently the US government has raised worries that Russia is testing nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) components, with the possibility that it will place a nuclear weapon in space. Such a device, if detonated, would destroy most of the satellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This danger is compounded by the lack of a verification mechanism for the OST. No methodologies of verification have been proposed in the open peer reviewed literature. This study presents a concept and a feasibility study for verifying a satellite's compliance to the OST by observing the neutrons induced by spallation from the $\\sim$GeV protons in the inner Van Allen radiation belts. The calculations show that a 9U CubeSat sized detection platform can identify a thermonuclear weapon from the distance of 4 km in approximately one week of observation. This conceptual study will stimulate and inform future research and development of verification platforms for OST.",

    "title": "Amplitude Walk in Fast Timing: The Role of Dual Thresholds",
    "abstract": "We apply lessons from fast timing detector R$\\&$D to strategies for initial calibration of large timing arrays at future colliders. Detector R$\\&$D often benefits from detailed information about the sensor and front-end signal (waveform capture) as well as a quality time reference and tracking. On the other hand, the systems for charged particle (MIP) timing under construction for the CERN High Luminosity LHC log only limited information for each timing channel -- usually amplitude and the time of the leading edge. Furthermore the high event rates certainly present a challenge for \\textit{in situ }calibration of the large (compared to intrinsic) time jitter of the leading edge with pulse amplitude -- amplitude walk. In the examples presented here we find a simple linear dependence of walk on the inverse of the pulse slope at threshold for the dynamic range (in amplitude) suitable to charged particle timing. We present a straightforward calibration method for the small variation in the corresponding coefficient from channel-to-channel.",

    "title": "Optimization and Performance Characterization of the Second Generation Fermilab Constant Fraction Discriminator Readout ASIC",
    "abstract": "We present the optimization and performance characterization of the second-generation Fermilab Constant Fraction Discriminator ASIC (FCFD), designed for the readout of AC-coupled low-gain avalanche detector (LGAD) strip-sensors. The FCFD is explicitly engineered to be insensitive to signal-amplitude variations, thereby removing the need for time-walk correction that is required in other LGAD time-stamping readout ASICs. This updated version, referred to as FCFD1.1, incorporates several enhancements over the first iteration to address key challenges in AC-coupled LGAD front-end design. We outline the primary readout-ASIC design considerations for these applications, describe the methodology used to evaluate critical sensor and system parameters, and summarize the additionally implemented features. Performance measurements using injected charge signals and minimum-ionizing particles in test-beams demonstrate a time resolution of approximately 40 ps and a position resolution of roughly \\SI{15}{\\micro\\meter} when tested with beam particles uniformly over the active area of the sensor.",

    "title": "Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks",
    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfvénic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfvénic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.",

    "title": "Hydrogen bonding in water under extreme confinement",
    "abstract": "Fluids under extreme confinement exhibit unique structures and intermolecular bonding, distinct from their bulk analogs, driving innovative applications at the water-energy nexus. Probing confined water experimentally at the length scale of intermolecular and surface forces has, however, remained a challenge. Here, we report direct molecular-level observations of hydrogen bonding in water confined inside individual carbon nanotubes, enabled by in-situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy with nanoscale resolution. Hydrogen bonding is probed via the intramolecular O-H stretching frequency, which serves as a sensitive spectral signature of the local intermolecular bonding environment. Water in larger carbon nanotubes exhibit the bonded O-H vibrations of bulk water, but at smaller diameters, the frequency blueshifts to near the free O-H stretch found in water vapor and hydrophobic surfaces, indicating a highly dispersed, non-H-bonded environment. Theoretical analysis based on quantum vibrational oscillators indicates that enhanced damping rates, corresponding to rapid hydrogen-bond fluctuations, leads the bimodal spectral peaks to merge into a single broad feature, matching the experimental observation. Furthermore, cryogenic experiments provide insights into complex structural phase transitions of confined water. This research reveals the quantum and dynamic nature of hydrogen bonds under confinement and the potential impact of unveiling molecular-level structure and bonding in confined fluids.",

    "title": "Picosecond laser test unit for photosensor characterization at ambient and low temperatures",
    "abstract": "Accurate single photoelectron (SPE) characterization of photosensors is essential for controlling systematic uncertainties in low-light neutrino and dark matter detectors. We present a compact laboratory setup for the characterization of photosensors under controlled, low-light conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate its use with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operated at the SPE-level, using picosecond laser pulses and waveform digitization to determine key PMT properties. Measurements as a function of supply voltage and temperature ($-50^\\circ$C to $+20^\\circ$C) are performed on ET Enterprises 9821(Q)B tubes and a Hamamatsu R9980 assembly, which show exponential gain-voltage behavior and device-to-device variation. Cooling increases the gain by $\\sim 0.1\\,\\%/^\\circ$C, while the transit time spread (TTS) and peak-to-valley ratio (P/V) exhibit no clear temperature dependence. TTS decreases with voltage. Late pulses remain at the percent level and prepulses at the sub-percent level. Cable length affects both apparent gain and TTS. A model-independent, data-driven self-convolution method is introduced to quantify double photoelectron contributions from pulse charge spectra. The procedures provide a reproducible, practice-oriented reference for SPE-level PMT characterization and can be extended to other photosensor types.",

    "abstract": "Large-amplitude slow-mode waves are commonly observed near Earth's magnetopause. Recent observations show that these waves can occur simultaneously with kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves. The amplitude of the ion acoustic waves is enhanced near the magnetic field peaks of the slow-mode wave, suggesting that the slow-mode waves may drive the generation of ion acoustic waves. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a hybrid simulation using observation-based parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that large-amplitude slow-mode waves generate counter-streaming ion beams, which in turn excite ion acoustic waves and relax the ion beams. Our study reveals a clear energy transfer channel from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves.",

    "abstract": "We present the baseline design of the electron ring collimation system for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The system addresses beam losses in a high-current electron storage ring with superconducting (SC) final-focus magnets and sensitive detectors, where uncontrolled losses can generate heat loads, radiation, and detector backgrounds and damage. The proposed collimation insertion localizes halo particle losses through reducing interaction region beam losses from beam-gas and Touschek scattering by several orders of magnitude while keeping detector backgrounds and cryostat heat loads within acceptable limits. Multi-turn particle tracking simulations show that the collimators do not significantly impact machine acceptance or beam lifetime, and their positions and apertures can be re-optimized for future lattice configurations. Ongoing work includes incorporating crab cavities and solenoid fields into simulations, refining vacuum conditions, and optimizing collimator geometry and materials. This design establishes a robust baseline for the EIC electron ring collimation system and supports continued lattice optimization for machine operations.",

    "title": "Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields",
    "abstract": "Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (> 5σ) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.",

    "title": "Time-domain anode-decoupling co-design for a floating MCP TOF-MS readout",
    "abstract": "We present a microchannel plate detector for compact time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) that jointly optimizes the anode geometry and high-voltage AC-decoupling network for electrically floating operation. Undershoot-driven baseline artifacts and pulse broadening are addressed by a time-domain co-design of the anode geometry and decoupling network. The design is validated through a staged workflow that combines full-wave electromagnetic simulations, vector network analyzer measurements, circuit-level transient models, and end-to-end mass spectra. The resulting planar circular patch anode with anode-proximal decoupling confines fields, preserves peak amplitude, and suppresses post-pulse energy, leading to fast settling and minimal baseline wander. We show that the effective high-pass corner set by the decoupling capacitance directly governs undershoot decay and baseline recovery. Measurements in a representative TOF-MS test setup demonstrate waveguide-level pulse fidelity at a fraction of the mass and volume of heritage waveguide-based detectors, with residual ripples in the measured response originating from downstream cable and digitizer terminations rather than the detector itself. By limiting detector-induced temporal broadening and inter-peak baseline coupling, the design supports high mass resolution and dynamic range in miniaturized TOF-MS architectures. Variants of this planar flight-ready architecture are being implemented in several next-generation spaceborne TOF-MS instruments currently under development at the University of Bern.",
