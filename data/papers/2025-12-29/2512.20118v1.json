  "title": "Evaluation of the Front-End FERS 5202 Readout System for Muon Radiography Applications",
  "abstract": "This work presents a comprehensive characterization of the FERS 5202 front-end readout unit when processing signals from Silicon Photo-multipliers (SiPMs). The readout system's performance is characterized in terms of its charge resolution, dynamic range, and noise performance at the single photoelectron level, which is critical for applications requiring detection of low-light signals such as medical imaging, high-energy physics experiments and photon counting applications. The evaluation encompassed both fundamental performance metrics and practical implementation scenarios using Hamamatsu MPPC devices. This work aims to provide valuable reference data not only for our intended muon radiography application but also for the broader scientific community employing SiPMs in diverse experimental contexts.",
