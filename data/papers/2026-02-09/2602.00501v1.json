  "title": "KEK Accelerator Test Facility Low-Level RF and Timing Systems",
  "abstract": "The KEK Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) is a dedicated testbed for nanobeam technologies in support of the International Linear Collider (ILC). Stable pulsed operation requires synchronization of the facility timing system with the Low-Level RF (LLRF) system. The timing system distributes trigger and gate signals to key subsystems, including the DAQ, klystrons, laser systems, pulsed kicker magnets, and interlocks. The LLRF system provides phase-coherent RF references and facility-wide clock distribution for synchronization. Achieving ~100 fs-level synchronization depends critically on the phase-noise power spectral density (PN-PSD) of the distributed clock signals and on preserving this performance throughout the distribution network. We present facility-wide measurements of the KEK ATF LLRF clock PN-PSD and discuss the resulting synchronization floor imposed by the stability of the ATF Linac and Damping Ring signal generators.",
