  "title": "Evaluation of the beam-induced depolarization of the HJET target at the EIC",
  "abstract": "The Polarized Atomic Hydrogen Gas Jet Target (HJET) has played a central role in the absolute calibration of proton beam polarization at RHIC and is foreseen as a key element of the hadron polarimetry program at the future Electron--Ion Collider (EIC). The substantially higher beam current, reduced bunch spacing, and shorter bunch length planned for EIC operation motivate a careful reassessment of possible beam-induced depolarization of the jet target. In this paper, the depolarization of ground-state hydrogen atoms caused by the time-dependent magnetic field of the circulating polarized proton beam is quantitatively evaluated. The hydrogen atom is treated as a four-level hyperfine system in a holding magnetic field, and transitions driven by harmonic components of the bunch-induced magnetic field are analyzed using time-dependent quantum-mechanical evolution along atomic trajectories. Numerical tracking of hydrogen atoms through the beam region is performed using nominal EIC beam parameters. It is shown that, for a holding field of $120\\,\\mathrm{mT}$ (as used at RHIC), the resulting depolarization of the jet target at the EIC is negligibly small, $\\lesssim 0.01\\%$, and well below the level relevant for EIC polarization accuracy requirements. The stability of this result with respect to plausible variations of the EIC proton beam parameters is also evaluated.",
