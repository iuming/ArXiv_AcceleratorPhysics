  "abstract": "Radiofrequency (RF) systems play a critical role in particle accelerators by enabling the acceleration, manipulation, and diagnosis of charged particle beams. At the heart of many of these systems lies the RF cavity, whose effective design requires close collaboration among RF designers, beam physicists, and mechanical engineers. This chapter presents the fundamental principles of RF systems, with particular emphasis on RF cavities, and underscores the interdisciplinary effort involved in their development. The SwissFEL X-ray free-electron laser at the Paul Scherrer Institut serves as a key example to illustrate these concepts.",
