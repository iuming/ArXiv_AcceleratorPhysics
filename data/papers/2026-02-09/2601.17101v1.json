  "title": "Accelerating Molecular H$_2^+$ Beam in AGS and RHIC",
  "abstract": "After the recent success of acceleration molecular H$_2^+$ beam (from EBIS) in Booster to 1.0 GeV/u kinetic energy, we propose to carry out tests to accelerate H$_2^+$ beam in AGS (up to 12 GeV/u) and to RHIC (up to 100 GeV/u). In this Note, we address the main effects that might hamper H$_2^+$ beam acceleration, outline the impacts and benefits of high energy H$_2^+$ beam to BNL.",
