  "title": "FAIR Commissioning - Towards First Science",
  "abstract": "The international Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is under construction at the GSI Helmholtz Centre in Darmstadt. The first project stage includes the superconducting 100 Tm heavy-ion synchrotron SIS100, the Super Fragment Separator, and associated beam transport lines. Part of GSI's existing accelerator chain, comprising UNILAC and SIS18, will serve as injector. Installation work in the FAIR accelerator tunnels and supply buildings has been ongoing since early 2024. As progress continues, special attention is now on the start of commissioning, beginning in 2025 with the cryogenic plant. Commissioning of the transport line will follow at the end of 2025, and beam commissioning is scheduled for the second half of 2027. This paper outlines the current status of the project, commissioning strategy and timeline.",
