  "title": "A further study on the high-precision optics for HIAF-BRing",
  "abstract": "All equipment for the High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) has been installed and beam commissioning is currently underway. This paper presents a further study on the high-precision optics, namely slice optics, of the Booster Ring (BRing) at HIAF based on measured magnetic fields, focusing on two aspects: closed-orbit distortion and optical parameter variations caused by errors, and dynamic aperture. A detailed study is conducted on the closed-orbit distortion and changes in optical parameters caused by magnet alignment errors and dipole magnet field errors. Meanwhile, A detailed study is also conducted on the dynamic aperture of BRing. The results show that the sliced optics and the original optics are comparable in terms of the impact of these errors on the closed-orbit and optical parameters. Without chromaticity correction, the dynamic aperture of the sliced optics is superior to that of the original optics; after chromaticity correction, the sliced optics is also comparable to the original optics. This study provides valuable insights for accelerator tuning and optimization.",
