  "title": "Efficient Simulation of Electron-Positron Pair Production in Foam Targets in the low χ-Regime",
  "abstract": "The generation of electron-positron pairs using direct laser-accelerated electrons and a cone-shaped reflector target for the generation of strong electromagnetic fields is investigated using particle-in-cell simulations. A newly implemented sub-sampling routine for the code vlpl is presented which allows for a better description of quantum electrodynamical processes which would otherwise come at a high computational cost.",
