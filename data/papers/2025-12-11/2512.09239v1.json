  "title": "Non-invasive Techniques for Flow Rate Measurement in Water Pipes: Protocol for a Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Accurate, non-invasive flow measurement is imperative for efficient water resource management and leak detection in distribution systems. Despite the advent of diverse external sensing technologies, a paucity of consolidated evidence exists regarding their comparative performance, energy efficiency, and applicability in varied operational contexts. The document delineates the protocol for a systematic literature review (SLR) that aims to identify, evaluate, and synthesize the extant evidence on non-invasive flow monitoring techniques for piped networks. Adhering to the Kitchenham methodology, the review will investigate the accuracy, precision, and energy consumption of prevailing solutions, such as ultrasonic and accelerometer-based systems. The analysis will also assess the impact of signal processing and machine learning (ML) algorithms on enhancing system capabilities. The objective of this study is to map the state-of-the-art, identify key research gaps, and provide an empirical foundation to direct future research toward operational deployment.",
