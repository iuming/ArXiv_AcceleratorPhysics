  "title": "Plasma waveguides for high-intensity laser pulses",
  "abstract": "Fundamental to many applications of laser pulses in science and technology is an extended interaction length with matter that significantly exceeds the distance over which the pulse would normally diffract and transversely spread. At low intensity, the interaction could simply be the linear refraction provided by a glass optical fiber to keep the pulse from spreading. At increased pulse intensity, more than diffraction-free pulse transport is of interest: an extended interaction length of high intensity light can give rise to bright secondary sources of photons, and at relativistic intensities, beams of high energy charged particles. As generation of these secondary sources requires laser intensities well above the threshold for ionization of atoms, new methods for defeating pulse diffraction in a plasma have been developed. Chief among them are plasma waveguides: optical fibers composed of plasma that have characteristic mode structure. This article reviews the methods and theory of plasma waveguides, highlighting the recent development of meter-scale plasma waveguides that have been instrumental to the laser acceleration of high charge electron beams to ~10 GeV.",
