  "title": "Development & first Performance evaluation of multielement monolithic HPGe detector for spectroscopy applications",
  "abstract": "We present the first operational prototype of a high-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector developed within the framework of the European LEAPS-INNOV project. This prototype features a monolithic, multi-element sensor optimized for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy in the hard X-ray regime. The study includes a comprehensive laboratory-based characterization of the detector's spectral and spatial performance, and an on-beam evaluation at the BM05 beamline of the ESRF synchrotron facility using monochromatic X-rays in the 20-50 keV energy range. Detailed characterization results are reported, including sensor performance metrics such as energy resolution, count rate, and spatial response uniformity.",
