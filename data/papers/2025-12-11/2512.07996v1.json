  "title": "ALS Storage Ring RF Control System Upgrade Plan and Status",
  "abstract": "The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a third-generation synchrotron light source operational since 1992, is undergoing a comprehensive upgrade of its storage ring RF control system. The legacy Horner PLC controllers and remote I/O modules, now at end-of-life, are being replaced with an Allen-Bradley PLC platform to improve maintainability, reliability, and long-term support. This paper presents the planning, design, and current status of the upgrade project.",
