  "title": "Modeling of van-der-Meer scan at NICA",
  "abstract": "Van-der-Meer method is used in hadron colliders for absolute luminosity calibration. In the letter the applicability of the method is discussed when particles desnsity is distorted by hour-glass effect next to interaction point. The study is motivated by close commisioning of Nuclotron based Ion Collider fAcility where hour-glass effected is significant by design. The theoretical van-der-Meer formalism is revised for this case. Importance of hour-glass effect for luminosity measurements and calibration is demonstrated. Also, the general approach to the estimation of van-der-Meer method bias when it is used for non-factorizable beams is proposed.",
