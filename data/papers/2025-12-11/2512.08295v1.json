  "title": "Photon Phase-Space Dynamics in a Plasma Wakefield Accelerator",
  "abstract": "Frequency up-shifting of laser light in a beam-driven plasma wakefield has the potential to provide high-intensity sources of short wavelength radiation. Simulations have demonstrated that a laser pulse can undergo large frequency shifts, limited only by the drive beam energy, when the plasma density is tailored to match the accelerating phase of the wake to the group velocity of the pulse. Here, we study the dynamical evolution of photons in the phase-space vicinity of the plasma wake-phase matching condition. Numerical calculations using a photon kinetic model are validated by direct comparison with full electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations. These calculations form the basis of a linear theory of the photon dynamics which reveals several important results, including scalings for the properties of the witness pulse and a self-similar solution for the photon phase-space dynamics. One prediction of the theory is that the pulse can be compressed indefinitely with no lower bound on the duration. This predication suggests that photon acceleration can provide a novel source of sub-femtosecond, short wavelength radiation.",
