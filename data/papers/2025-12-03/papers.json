    "title": "Characterisation of the LAPPD, a large area microchannel-plate PMT",
    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive characterization of the LAPPD Gen-II, a large-area microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) equipped with a capacitively coupled sensing (readout) electrode. Two detector variants with different geometries and materials were investigated using a picosecond pulsed laser system. We measured the single-photon timing response and spatial charge distribution on segmented readout electrodes. The prompt timing peak exhibits a resolution of approximately 30 ps, with the overall timing structure explained by photoelectron propagation and back-scattering effects from the MCP input surface. We developed analytical models that describe the propagation of photoelectrons and the induced charge spread on the sensing electrodes, including secondary electron backscattering from the resistive anode. The model accurately reproduces the measured device properties and enables performance extrapolations for various detector geometries and dielectric properties. These results provide a predictive framework for optimizing MCP-PMTs for timing- and imaging-critical applications such as RICH detectors in high-energy physics and TOF-PET systems for medical imaging.",

    "title": "Discovery and rectification of an error in high resistance traceability at NPL: a case study in how metrology works",
    "abstract": "We broach a seldom-discussed topic in precision metrology; how subtle errors in calibration processes are discovered and remedied. We examine a case study at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, involving the calibration of DC standard resistors of value 100 MOhm and 1 GOhm. Results from the period 2001 to 2015 were in error by approximately 0.7 parts per million (ppm), with quoted uncertainties (k=2) of 0.4 ppm and 1.6 ppm respectively. Inter-comparisons did not detect the error, mainly because the uncertainty due to the transportation drift of the comparison standards was too large to resolve it. Likewise, research into single-electron current standards did not detect the error because at this resistance value it was on the borderline of statistical significance. The key event was a comparison between PTB (Germany) and NPL (UK) of a new small-current measuring instrument, the ultrastable low-noise current amplifier (ULCA). At that time, the transport stability of the ULCA was not well established. Nevertheless, calibrations of the ULCA at NPL using a 100 MOhm resistor were sufficiently discrepant with the PTB calibrations to motivate a thorough investigation into the NPL traceability chain, which uncovered the error. This instructive episode illustrates a positive interplay between calibration and research activities and shows that cutting-edge calibration uncertainties must be supported by a vigorous research programme. It is also important for NMIs to maintain a comfortable buffer (at least a factor of 10) between their claimed uncertainty and the uncertainty that their customers require, so that small errors can be resolved without significant impact on measurement stakeholders.",

    "title": "Position-Sensitive Silicon Photomultiplier Array with Enhanced Position Reconstruction by means of a Deep Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Single-photon sensitive detectors like Silicon Photomultipliers are widely used in many medical imaging applications. By using detectors with position resolutions, it is possible to build compact photodetector readouts with reduced number of channels, but still preserving position resolution and gamma-rays imaging capabilities. In this work, we present the advantage of using a Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) light position reconstruction applied to a 2x2 array of linearly-graded SiPMs (LG-SiPMs), to minimize the distortions on the reconstructed event maps. Our approach significantly enhances both the resolution and linearity of position detection compared to the nominal reconstruction formula based on the device architecture. Remarkably, the DNN-based reconstruction boosts the number of resolved areas (pixels) by a factor of at least 5.7, allowing a higher level of precision and performance in light detection.",

    "title": "New 1mm thick Silicon Drift Detectors for future researches of Kaonic Atoms and the Pauli Exclusion principle",
    "abstract": "Kaonic atoms, formed when a negatively charged kaon replaces an electron, provide a sensitive probe of the low-energy strong interaction via precision X-ray spectroscopy. The SIDDHARTA-2 experiment at the DA$Φ$NE collider employs high-performance Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) optimized for the 4-12 keV range to study light kaonic systems. In preparation for the EXKALIBUR phase, which targets heavier kaonic atoms, new 1 mm-thick SDDs have been developed with Politecnico di Milano and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. Their increased thickness enhances the quantum efficiency by a factor of about two at 30 keV while preserving excellent energy resolution. These detectors are also intended for VIP-3, the next-generation test of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP). Building on VIP-2, which set the most stringent limits on PEP-violating $K_α$ transitions in copper, VIP-3 will extend the search to heavier elements such as Ag, Sn, and Zr. Preliminary measurements demonstrate efficient detection up to 30 keV, supporting future high-precision studies of the kaon-nucleon interaction and PEP in heavier systems.",

Within the SIDDHARTA-2 program at the DA$Φ$NE collider, a new CZT-based detection system has been developed to enable precision measurements of kaonic atom transitions in the intermediate mass range. In this work, we report the results of a calibration campaign performed with the collider operating, aimed at assessing the detector performance. A dedicated setup, including an array of quasi-hemispherical CZT sensors and a $^{152}$Eu source, was used to characterize the spectral response. The reconstructed emission lines were fitted with a model accounting for Gaussian response and incomplete charge recollection tails, and the detector linearity was evaluated by comparing the measured peak positions with their nominal energies. The results demonstrate that the CZT detector exhibits excellent linearity and stable operation with the collider on, confirming its suitability for future kaonic-atom spectroscopy at DA$Φ$NE.",

    "abstract": "The detailed theoretical and numerical investigation of hybrid laser plasma RF accelerators, elucidating the mechanisms governing transverse beam dynamics, betatron polarization, and radiation reaction in ultra-relativistic electron bunches is presented. This framework combines analytical models of spatiotemporal plasma wakefield modulation, phase-dependent RF-driven oscillations, and quantum-corrected Landau Lifshitz radiation reaction with fully self-consistent 3D particle in cell simulations using EPOCH. The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate γ growth rates. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of nonlinear, resonant, and damping phenomena in hybrid laser plasma RF systems, highlighting the full spectrum of controllable transverse, longitudinal, and polarization dynamics in ultra relativistic electron beams.",

    "abstract": "Auto-differentiation is a powerful tool for computing derivatives of simulation results with respect to given parameters. In this letter, we have applied this tool to investigate the instability of a dynamics system that is governed by 21 ordinary differential equations. This second-order instability (named envelope instability) is driven by space-charge effects and has significant impact on the operational regimes of particle accelerators. Our study delves into the three-dimensional envelope instability, incorporating both transverse and longitudinal coupling. Conventionally, analyzing this complex system would necessitate solving 441 ordinary differential equations, which is computationally intractable. However, by employing auto-differentiation, we were able to track only 21 equations. This approach allowed us to uncover an additional instability stopband, which arises from space-charge-induced coupling and has not been reported in previous studies. This research highlights the significant advantages of auto-differentiation in analyzing complicated dynamical systems involving a large number of ordinary differential equations.",

Their unique ability to achieve ultra-low energy thresholds, typically O(eV-100 eV), together with excellent energy resolution and effective background suppression, makes them sensitive to extremely faint signals from rare interactions. These rare particle interactions produce phonons, ionization, or scintillation, depending on the target medium, which are registered by specialized sensors and converted into measurable signals.

This report examines the parameters and dynamics of 2.5~MeV proton beam operations in two configurations of the bare IOTA lattice: one for demonstrating Non-linear Integrable Optics with the Danilov-Nagaitsev magnet, and the other for use with electron cooling. We offer order-of-magnitude estimates of the transverse emittance growth rate as a function of beam intensity, highlighting contributions from residual gas scattering, intra-beam scattering, and space-charge effects. Under nominal conditions, the beam lifetime is projected to be less than 7~minutes at low intensity with the current vacuum quality, and fewer than 100,000~turns at high intensity due to strong space-charge effects. The calculations presented here will guide strategies to mitigate emittance growth and inform future IOTA experiments.",

Following some recent work at CERN measuring power current converter transients in relation to flux jumps, an additional differential current probe was added to the magnet instrumentation. Measurements of this probe, as well as the half coil voltage taps show a fast and substantial current change preceding the quench, hinting at coil motion. A simple model based on relative shift of the inner and outer layer coils was developed which suggests the magnitude of coil shift events is on the estimated relative coil shift from the magnet constraint conditions. The behavior is shown to be reversible and characteristic of stick-slip.",

We present a detailed characterization of this photosensor operated in cold xenon environments, focusing on its single photoelectron response, dark count rate, light emission, and afterpulsing behavior. The device demonstrated a gain exceeding $2\\cdot 10^6$ at the nominal voltage of -1.0 kV, along with a low dark count rate of $(0.4\\pm0.2)\\;\\text{Hz/cm}^2$. Due to the compact design, afterpulses exhibited short delay times, resulting in some cases in an overlap with the light-induced signal. To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two R12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. The segmented $2\\times2$ anode structure enabled lateral position reconstruction using a single photomultiplier tube, highlighting the potential of the sensor for effective event localization in future detectors.",

It goes through a loop where all the charged particles contribute to the cross section. To date, this $γγ\\to γγ$ process has been experimentally studied in the Delbrück scattering and splitting of photons in the Coulomb field of the nucleus, as well as at the LHC in the scattering of virtual photons in ion-ion collisions. Hopes for further study of this process are associated with high-luminosity $e^+e^-$ colliders (SuperKEKb, FCC, CEPC, ILC, CLIC) and gamma-gamma colliders based on the Compton scattering of laser photons on electrons. In this article, we show that there are some very serious background processes where the annihilation of electrons and positrons (real and virtual) produces a pair of photons flying into the detector, and the the remaining products fly away from the detector at small angles.",

It will mitigate pile-up effects in the forward region, and measure per bunch luminosity. The design of HGTD is based on Low Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD) sensors. This paper presents the results of beam-test campaigns conducted at CERN and DESY in 2023 and 2024 on single LGADs from HGTD pre-production test structures, before and after neutron irradiation up to fluences of $2.5 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{n_{eq}/cm^2}$. The tested LGADs can meet HGTD requirements in terms of charge collection, time resolution, and hit efficiency, even under HL-LHC end-of-life conditions, supporting their deployment in the final detector.",

    "title": "Energy recovery twin linear $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ colliders (ERLC ) with high luminosities and accelerating gradients",
    "abstract": "Recently, the $e^+e^-$ high-energy superconducting linear collider with energy recovery (ERLC) and multiple use of beams has been proposed, using twin RF structures to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider can operate in either pulsed (with duty factor DF) or CW (continuous) mode, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=$250-500 GeV. In this paper, we point out that the luminosity of the ERLC operating in the pulsed mode does not depend on the accelerating gradient G (for the same total power), allowing the ERLC to operate with the highest available accelerating gradients. This is also true for the CW mode at a power significantly exceeding the threshold power for this mode. The $e^+e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor of cavities as $L\\propto Q_0^{1/2}$. We also consider for the first time a twin $e^-e^-$ collider with energy recovery and estimate its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one. It does not require beam recycling since electrons can be produced anew each time. The $e^-e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor as $L\\propto Q_0^{1/4}$. RF travelling-wave structures allow higher gradients and reduced thermal loading. It is shown that an ERLC with an accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m can be operated in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1-2.5)\\,$10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3-7)$10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable total powers of 150 and 300 MW at $2E_0=250$ and 500 GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.",

    "title": "Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances",
    "abstract": "Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.",

    "abstract": "A method of constructing the high-beta (diamagnetic-bubble-like) equilibrium with a population of fast sloshing ions is discussed. Fast ions move along betatron orbits; such ions can arise because of off-axis neutral beam injection. Conservation of the adiabatic invariant of these ions is proposed; a simplified expression for the invariant is presented. Numerical examples of equilibrium with sloshing ions are shown and conservation of the invariant is justified by a direct numerical simulation of motion of fast ions even in the case with beta equal to 1.",

    "abstract": "Optically levitated particles are used in a wide range of experiments to explore both fundamental physics and to act as sensors to a variety of external forces. One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite. We will then review the aspects of the payload that require further development, then summarize the current estimates of the payload's requirements.",

    "title": "Characterization of cutting-edge CMOS Active Pixel sensors within the CYGNO Experiment",
    "abstract": "Time Projection Chambers equipped with Gas Electron Multipliers and optical readout by scientific CMOS cameras are a promising technology for low-energy particle detection, as demonstrated by the CYGNO experiment. To help identify the optimal CYGNO detector configuration, we performed a detailed characterization of two state-of-the-art scientific CMOS sensors, focusing on dark-signal behavior across different exposure times and on detection sensitivity, assessed using the well-defined X-ray emissions from a 55Fe source, which reproduce the low-light conditions expected in CYGNO.   CYGNO currently employs a very low-noise Hamamatsu sensor, the ORCA-Fusion, for testing and validation of its detection system. Hamamatsu has recently introduced two new sensors that may be of interest for future upgrades. The first is an improved version of the current model, the ORCA-Fusion-BT, featuring a back-illuminated design that reaches a quantum efficiency of up to 95% at 550 nm. The second is a next-generation sensor, the ORCA-Quest. Although its peak quantum efficiency is not as high as that of the Fusion-BT, it offers high sensitivity over a broader spectral range, extending into the ultraviolet region, and provides ultra-low readout noise of 0.27 electrons, about 2.6 times lower than that of the Fusion family.   These two sensors therefore represent a significant opportunity to enhance the performance of scientific experiments, including those conducted by the CYGNO collaboration. This document presents a comprehensive characterization of these sensors to evaluate their relevance for experiments operating in photon-limited environments and their suitability for integration into the CYGNO detector system.",

    "title": "Evolution of ion distribution functions in ionospheric plasmas perturbed by Alfvén waves",
    "abstract": "This study investigates ion kinetic effects during the parametric decay instability (PDI) of parallel-propagating Alfvén waves under plasma conditions characteristic of the Earth's ionosphere. By using a series of hybrid particle-in-cell simulations, we examine the evolution of ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) in ultra-low-beta plasmas. Our numerical campaign systematically explores the dependence on key parameters (plasma beta, pump-wave amplitude and polarization, and ion composition). To emphasize the role of kinetic effects, we choose to trigger the PDI with a dispersive mother wave with wavelength comparable to the ion characteristic inertial length. Our results reveal pronounced nonthermal VDF modifications, including parallel heating and the formation of secondary ion beams, linked to the nonlinear evolution of parametric decay instability. By varying the plasma beta and the pump-wave amplitude, we identify a critical regime where rapid and complete broadening of the velocity distribution function is observed, triggering bidirectional ion acceleration. Notably, simulations modeling realistic ionospheric conditions demonstrate that even low-amplitude Alfvénic perturbations can induce significant VDF spreading and ion beam generation, with hydrogen ions exhibiting stronger effects than oxygen. These nonthermal microscopic processes offer a plausible mechanism for particle precipitation in space weather events. This work represents the first comprehensive study with hybrid simulations of PDI-driven ion kinetics in ultra-low-beta plasmas, providing quantitative estimates for the time delay between electromagnetic wave impact and ion VDF modification and new insights into wave-particle interactions that may contribute to ion acceleration, precipitation processes and space plasma dynamics.",

    "title": "Injection and Acceleration of Electrons by Radially Polarized Laser Pulses in a Plasma Channel",
    "abstract": "We consider injection and subsequent acceleration of electrons in narrow plasma channels irradiated by linearly and radially polarized ultraintense laser pulses. Using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we show that radially polarized beams significantly promote electron release from the channel walls and lead to enhanced injection. We compare an f/10 linearly polarized laser beam with two radially polarized cases: one focused more tightly (f/5) to match peak intensity, and one at equal f/10 to capture polarization effects. The radially polarized f/10 case injects approximately one-third more charge than the linearly polarized case, while the f/5 radially polarized case outperforms the linearly polarized one by about a factor of two in terms of maximum electron energy. These results highlight polarization and focusing geometry as key parameters for optimizing laser-driven electron acceleration setups.",

    "abstract": "The trajectory of light rays propagating through a nonuniformly moving anisotropic medium is determined by considering the Fresnel drag experienced by the wave at each point along the ray. By showing that symmetries in the velocity field manifest as symmetries in the effective wave index representing the moving medium, methods classically employed to model gradient index media are then used to obtain analytical forms for the ray trajectory. When applied to isotropic media, the results are verified to be consistent with those obtained using an optical (Gordon) metric. The potential of this method to model light rays in anisotropic media is finally demonstrated by considering waves in a nonuniformly moving magnetized plasma, exposing how nonuniform motion and anisotropy can compete with one another.",

    "title": "Impact of local bunching factors in single-pass THz free electron lasers",
    "abstract": "In simulations for modern free-electron laser (FEL), shot noise plays a crucial role. While it is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, shot noise is typically modeled using macroparticles, whose bunching factors correspond to those of the much larger number of electrons. For short-wavelength FELs, the macroparticles are assumed to be uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength, since shot noise dominates the initial radiation - for instance, in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold at longer wavelengths, particularly in the THz range, where the bunch current profile is not uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength. Instead, the current profile dominates the initial bunching factors, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than shot noise. The slice-based bunching factors and bunching phases are derived for Gaussian distributions and compared with shot noise under the assumption that the current within each slice remains constant. Using the THz FEL at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a case study, the influence of the current profile has been benchmarked through simulations under very low bunch charge, where the real number of electrons can be modeled using the Genesis1.3 code. Additional simulations with the nominal working parameters of PITZ THz FEL have been compared with experimental data, indicating better agreement when the actual current profile is taken into account.",

    "title": "An Open-Path Eddy-Covariance Laser Spectrometer for Simultaneous Monitoring of CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O",
    "abstract": "We present E-CAHORS $-$ a compact mid-infrared open-path diode-laser spectrometer designed for the simultaneous measurement of carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor concentrations in the near-surface atmospheric layer. These measurements, combined with simultaneous data from a three-dimensional anemometer, can be used to determine fluxes using the eddy-covariance method. The instrument utilizes two interband cascade lasers operating at 2.78 $μ$m and 3.24 $μ$m within a novel four-pass M-shaped optical cell, which provides high signal power and long-term field operation without requiring active air sampling. Two detection techniques $-$ tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) and a simplified wavelength modulation spectroscopy (sWMS) $-$ were implemented and evaluated. Laboratory calibration demonstrated linear responses for all gases (R$^2$ $\\approx$ 0.999) and detection precisions at 10 Hz of 311 ppb for CO$_2$, 8.87 ppb for CH$_4$, and 788 ppb for H$_2$O. Field tests conducted at a grassland site near Moscow showed strong correlations (R = 0.91 for CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, R = 0.67 for CH$_4$) with commercial LI-COR LI-7200 and LI-7700 analyzers. The TDLAS mode demonstrated lower noise and greater stability under outdoor conditions, while sWMS provided baseline-free spectra but was more sensitive to power fluctuations. E-CAHORS combines high precision, multi-species sensing capability with low power consumption (10 W) and a compact design (4.2 kg).",

    "title": "Effects of Turbulent Energy Exchange between Electrons and Ions on Global Temperature Profiles",
    "abstract": "Microscale turbulence drives not only particle and heat transport but also energy exchange between different particle species. Previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that turbulent energy exchange can exceed collisional exchange in weakly collisional plasmas, and that ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence may hinder ion heating by alpha-heated electrons. In addition, it has been clarified that trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence transfers energy from electrons to ions, thereby enhancing ion heating. In this work, we extend these studies by examining the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles at a steady state using the one-dimensional transport solver GOTRESS. For the case of DIII-D discharge 128913 [A. E. White et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056116 (2008)], turbulent energy exchange has minimal influence on temperature profiles. However, in the case of enhanced electron heating in a DIIID like tokamak plasma, energy transfer from hot electrons to cold ions driven by TEM turbulence becomes comparable to, or even exceeds, the collisional contribution, leading to a significant increase in the ion temperature profile. For ITER Baseline and SPARC standard H-mode scenarios [N.T. Howard et al., Nucl. Fusion 65, 016002(2024), P. Rodriguez Fernandez et al., J. Plasma Phys. 86, 865860503(2020)], the turbulent energy exchange is largely compensated by the collisional one, producing only small effects. These results indicate that the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles in steady state conditions of future fusion reactor scenarios is expected to be negligibly small, although it can become significant in situations such as plasma start up phases, where the heating power is strongly unbalanced between electrons and ions.",

    "abstract": "High-energy gamma-ray spectroscopy is crucial for studying and advancing the application of high-energy photons in areas like strong-field physics, high-energy-density science, and laboratory astrophysics. However, high-energy gamma-ray spectroscopy in the multi-MeV to GeV range faces significant challenges in precise spectral reconstruction. This study presents a machine learning-based inversion approach that combines a spectrometer design with advanced deconvolution algorithms. We develop a gamma-ray spectrometer optimized through Monte Carlo simulations for maximum positron yield and minimal noise. A two-stage neural network framework is proposed based on the structure of the spectrometer: a denoising autoencoder suppresses statistical noise in measured positron spectra, while a U-Net architecture solves the ill-posed inverse problem to reconstruct incident gamma spectra. This approach establishes a new methodology for gamma-ray diagnostics in strong-field QED experiments and high-energy photon sources.",

    "title": "Combined Effects of Transient Ionizing and Electromagnetic Pulse on Vertical NPN Bipolar Transistor",
    "abstract": "Combined effects of transient ionizing and electromagnetic pulse on vertical NPN bipolar transistor were experimentally investigated under pulsed X-ray irradiation. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation method was also employed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone. These findings provide critical insights for the radiation-hardening design of bipolar circuits in harsh radiation environments.",

    "abstract": "The combination of low temperature and low vibration levels is key for ultrasensitive sensing applications such as scanning probe microscopy, large-mass quantum mechanics, and gravitational wave detection. Unfortunately, closed-cycle cryostats using pulse tube or GM coolers introduce strong low-frequency vibrations starting at 1 Hz. Mass-spring systems allow passive isolation, but for low-frequency applications the required spring constants and masses become impractical. Blade-based geometric anti-spring systems are compact isolators that operate from sub-Hz frequencies, but have not been demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we characterize a geometric anti-spring system tuned to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Our cryogenic filter uses radially arranged titanium blade springs whose effective spring constant can be tuned in-situ using a magnetic actuator. Our system achieves a vertical resonance frequency of 185 mHz at 7K, which allows reduction of vibrations at the problematic 1 Hz cooler frequency by an order of magnitude.",

For performing a differential analysis, experiments are conducted by considering the resonant structure with and without a sensitive layer. Our experiments show the high interference of humidity on the sensor's performances and highlight the importance of differential study to decorrelate physical and chemical surrounding parameters. This differential innovative structure paves the way for a very high sensitive passive RF sensor dedicated for gas sensing.",

    "title": "Capturing methane in a barn environment: the CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project",
    "abstract": "The CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project explores the development of a prototype system for capturing methane emissions in barn environments, offering an alternative approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming. Methane (CH4), with a global warming potential significantly higher than CO2 (GWP100 = 27), accounts for ~23% of anthropogenic climate impact. In 2021, The Assessment Report 6 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change quantified CH4 livestock emissions in 123 Mt/yr, which, together with substantial N2O and CO2 emissions, contributed with a 12% to global emissions. Unlike strategies focused on altering animal feed, CH4rLiE investigates post-emission capture using porous materials, such as zeolites, to adsorb methane from barn air. The project draws on CERN's experience with gas recovery systems for particle detectors, adapting similar technologies to agricultural settings. Preliminary estimates, based on measured CH4 concentrations (~20 mg/m3) and partial air filtration in a 250-animal barn, suggest a low but detectable recovery potential, subject to validation through simulation and in-situ testing. Prototype development considers the potential for energy-efficient operation - possibly through pressure swing regeneration - and compatibility with existing ventilation infrastructure, though these aspects remain under evaluation. If methane concentrations in barns prove too diluted, the system may be better suited for environments with higher gas levels, such as pigsties or landfills. NH3 capture for fertilizer production is planned as a future enhancement. CH4rLiE aims to assess the feasibility of emission recovery in livestock settings without affecting animal welfare, contributing to sustainable farming practices, resource efficiency, and circular bioeconomy goals.",

The dark current rate (DCR) was measured to be $\\sim$ 1 Hz for the $\\sim$ 100 mm$^2$-size SiPMs, or 0.01 Hz/mm$^2$, which is $\\sim$ 7 orders lower than the DCR at room temperature (RT). Given the very low DCR at these cryogenic temperatures, we measured the SiPMs' I-V curves with such a method: illuminated the SiPMs with weak light, which differs from the conventional measurements at RT. Then, we measured the photo-detection efficiency (PDE), after-pulse (AP), and cross-talk (CT) with a bias voltage ranging from overvoltage (OV) 5 to 11 V. At the OV interval (5 to 11 V), the PDE was between 20\\% - 45\\%, and the AP and CT were both between $\\sim$ 5\\% and $\\sim$ 20\\%. With an OV higher than 10 V, the PDE would be $\\ge$ 40\\%, and the AP and CT are $\\sim$ 20\\%. Combining all of the measurements, we are confident that the SiPMs can be equipped as the photosensors on liquid helium detectors, including but not limited to the time projection chambers, which we have proposed in hunting for low-mass dark matter directly and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI) is a powerful technique to characterize aerosol particles, which so far has been applied only to particles larger than about 100 wavelengths. We extend its applicability to smaller ice crystals, combining rigorous modelling of particle shapes with the Phase Field Modelling and light-scattering simulations with the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). Even for particles with the largest dimension of 11.5 wavelengths (and the smallest one comparable to the wavelength), the 2D Fourier transform of the interferometric image remains linked to the 2D autocorrelation of the particle shape at various viewing angles, validating the general measurement principle. However, the sensor must necessarily have wide viewing angle, which complicates interpretation of apparent particle shape, when such particles are observed from the edge. IPI is, thus, shown to be a powerful optical technology for characterizing ice particles down to a few micrometers in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, DDA is a versatile method for such synthetic experiments and can further supply large datasets for development of various inversion methods.",

Its performance critically depends on the stability, active-area coverage, and spatial resolution of position-sensitive detectors. In this work, we report on the development of four compact scintillating fiber modules, each 100 cm long and composed of two staggered layers of 1 mm diameter fibers. The fibers are read out at one end by one-dimensional silicon photomultiplier arrays with a 2 mm pitch, coupled to Citiroc 1A-based front-end electronics. The modules were characterized with cosmic-ray muons, yielding a detection efficiency above 97% and a mean spatial resolution of about 0.56 mm, with uniform response over different distances from the readout end. An imaging test of a lead block was also performed, and the reconstructed results are consistent with the blocks profile. These results demonstrate the suitability of this detector design for compact and large-area systems in muon tomography applications.",

    "title": "Time Evolution of the Pinch Region of a Deflagration Plasma Accelerator",
    "abstract": "A spectroscopic study of a plasma deflagration accelerator was carried out to investigate the temporal evolution of plasma density within the pinch region. A half-meter imaging monochromator, paired with a fast (10 MHz) camera operating at 1 MHz, was used to collect broadened chord-integrated spectral lines from the pinch region of a plasma deflagration device. Specifically, images of the $H_β$ and the $H_α$ lines were taken - with the $H_α$ used to find the background continuum. Voigt fits of the Abel inverted H$_β$ emission lines allowed for determination of the radial profile of the number density in the pinch at intervals of 1 $μ$s. This provided insight into the formation, growth, and decay of the pinch in both the deflagration and detonation modes of the accelerator. It was found that the maximum density for the deflagration increased from $\\sim 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$ 1.4 cm away from the core of the pinch to $\\sim 10^{23}$ m$^{-3}$ at the core of the deflagration pinch. In contrast, the detonation pinch featured a broader zone of relatively constant density on the order of $\\sim 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$. Furthermore, an energy balance of the plasma in the deflagration pinch and downstream, as informed by prior work, was done to get an estimate of temperatures in the core of the pinch where measurements are not currently possible revealing potential temperatures on the 550 eV in the core of the pinch suggesting departures from some of the assumptions in the analysis.",

    "title": "Near-field perturbation of laser filament enabling simultaneous far-field THz diagnosis and broadband calculus processing",
    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) wave manipulation based on laser filaments-plasma channels formed by femtosecond laser-induced air ionization-has emerged as a promising platform for free-space THz applications. However, in-situ characterization of the spatially confined THz modes within filaments faces significant challenges due to the plasma's ultra-high intensity, which not only hinders direct near-field probing but also limits reliance on indirect far-field reconstruction. Here, we introduce a non-invasive near-field modulation scheme where a metal plate approaches the filament at submillimeter distances (comparable to THz wavelengths), perturbing the dielectric environment to convert the symmetric annular THz mode into an asymmetric state. This controlled transition enables far-field detection of broadband calculus behaviors (first- and second-order differentiation/integration) on time-domain THz waveforms and characteristic spectral transfer functions with 1/f, 1/f^2, f or f^2 dependency (where f is the THz frequency), thereby diagnosing the near-field THz mode confinement. Hence, the proposed approach synergizes near-field modulation efficiency with far-field detection robustness, advancing fundamental understanding of plasma-THz interactions and enabling novel all-optical signal processing for filament-based THz technologies.",

    "abstract": "The projected rapid growth of battery cell production over the next decade demands advanced diagnostic tools for quality control, ageing prediction, and recycling. Most existing techniques lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to capture internal electrochemical processes non-invasively. Here, we present magnetic imaging of current densities in battery cells, a sensitive quantum-magnetometry method that uses optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to perform real-time imaging of internal dynamics in open-circuit configuration. We demonstrate this approach for monitoring relaxation processes in 6000 mA h lithium-ion cells following pulsed discharges across a range of pulse durations and currents as well as states of charge. The measurement results are benchmarked against superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometry and validated with three-dimensional finite element simulations. Equivalent circuit models are employed to interpret the relaxation profiles, revealing spatially resolved features and transient magnetic-field signatures that are inaccessible with complementary non-invasive techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This work establishes OPM-based magnetic imaging of battery current density as a powerful diagnostic tool with potential impact on cell development, manufacturing quality assurance, and second-life assessment.",

    "abstract": "By returning to the topological basics of fusion target design, Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) is used to specify how to initially configure and drive the optimally entangled topological state, and stabilize that topological state from disruption. This can be applied to all methods; including tokamaks, laser-driven schemes, and pulsed-power driven schemes. This target design philosophy has the potential to yield practical, room temperature targets that could yield up to 10 GJ of energy, driven by as little as 3 MJ of absorbed energy. The genAI is based on the concept of Ubuntu that replaces the Deep Convolutional Neural Network approximation of a functional, with the formula for the generating functional of a canonical transformation from the domain of the canonical field momentums and fields, to the domain of the canonical momentums and coordinates, that is the Reduced Order Model. This formula is a logical process of renormalization, that has the potential to enable Heisenberg's canonical approach to field theory, via calculation of the S-matrix, given observation of the fields. This can be viewed as topological characterization and control of collective, that is complex, systems.",

    "abstract": "We present a synchronization-free differential observable for one-way inter-satellite laser ranging, designed to suppress first-order Doppler effects without requiring clock synchronization between spacecraft. The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.",

    "title": "Fundamental Advances in Short-Circuit Measurement: A Novel Time-Resolved Diode-Clamp Circuit Paradigm",
    "abstract": "Conventional electrical fault models, which rely on static thresholds and instantaneous trip mechanisms, fail to capture the time-evolving dynamics of real faults, creating vulnerabilities in modern power systems. This paper introduces a diode-clamp circuit architecture that reconceives short-circuits as governed, sustained processes and establishes a physics-consistent, measurement system. An Arduino-based data acquisition system recorded continuous fault evolution across multiple input voltages and durations. Multi-resolution sampling at 10ms, 50ms, and 100ms enabled high-fidelity capture of both transients and sustained-state dynamics. The clamped mechanism constrained the circuit to a bounded regime, enabling repeatable observation. Experiments yielded definitive, measurable minima and maxima for voltage, current, and resistance, empirically refuting the classical assumption of instantaneous, unbounded current. Newly introduced metrics quantify this performance: the Sustained-to-Capacitive Energy Ratio (SCER ~1.53x10^12) proves fault energy originates from sustained dynamics, not transient discharge. The Sustained Fault Efficiency (SFE>1) demonstrates that governed fault power can exceed nominal operating power. This work provides the first fully validated short-circuit quantification system, yielding empirical data for next-generation battery management, adaptive grid protection, and fault-tolerant electronics.",

    "title": "A Core Ontology for Particle Accelerators: Interoperable Data and Workflows Across Facilities",
    "abstract": "We propose a small, shared core ontology for particle accelerators that provides a semantic backbone for interoperable data and workflows across facilities. The ontology names key device types, signals, parameters, and regions, and relates them through explicit properties (e.g., hasSetpoint, hasReadback, partOf). Each site contributes a lightweight facility bundle, a profile that maps local conventions into the shared vocabulary plus data slices that instantiate those mappings, without renaming channel addresses or changing existing systems. Using standard W3C technologies, the approach supports both sparse and rich descriptions. We demonstrate the idea on two beamline segments at different laboratories. A single semantic query is expressed once and evaluated against both knowledge bases, returning the locally correct PVs. The ontology thereby enables not only portable workflows but also interoperable data, since measurements and catalogs are annotated with shared semantics rather than facility-specific names. The framework complements, rather than replaces, existing middle layers and lattice/data standards, and it creates a stable foundation for reusable tools and agentic workflows.",

    "abstract": "We present a class of self-similar solutions describing ultrahigh compression of a uniform-density target by spherically converging, stacked shock waves. Extending the classical Guderley model, we derive a scaling law for the final density of the form $ρ_{r}/ρ_{0} \\propto \\hat{P}^{β(N-1)}$, where $N$ is the number of shocks, $\\hat{P}$ the stage pressure ratio, and $β$ a numerical exponent determined by the adiabatic index $γ$. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations confirm the validity of this scaling across a broad parameter range. Notably, the relation remains accurate even in the strongly nonlinear regime up to $\\hat{P} \\sim 70$, well beyond the perturbative limit, highlighting the robustness and practical relevance of the model. Owing to its volumetric geometry, this compression scheme inherently avoids the Rayleigh--Taylor instability, which typically compromises shell-based implosions, and thereby establishes a theoretical benchmark for instability-free compression in inertial confinement fusion.",

In this paper we investigate the birefringence properties of this crystalline semiconductor material by modulating the optical illumination on the mirror coating and monitoring the induced birefringence. While the measured low-frequency birefringence values align with previous studies, we observed a frequency-dependent behavior in the illumination-to-birefringence coupling, characterized by a pole increasing with illumination intensity and a DC gain decreasing with illumination intensity. We developed a theoretical mode based on a master equation to characterize the measurement results by considering photon-induced electric fields and electro-optical effects. This model reproduces the frequency and intensity dependencies of the induced birefringence. Additionally, this model predicts a generation-recombination noise (GR noise) will be observable in the coatings birefringence. While the presented measurement cannot predict the exact level of GR noise, for the frequency band and spot sizes relevant for gravitational-wave detectors we expect GR noise to be white below the pole frequency, scale with power the same way laser shot noise does, and for fixed power be independent of spot size.",

    "title": "Edge-localized-mode heat load effects on plasma-facing materials studied using runaway electrons in the Damavand tokamak",
    "abstract": "Edge localized modes (ELMs) and runaway electrons (REs) pose significant challenges for all Tokamak devices and act as potent heat sources, potentially shortening the lifespan of plasma-facing materials (PFMs). These thermal loads can manifest in various detrimental effects, including melting, sputtering, cracking, blistering, and other forms of material degradation. While the ELMs are an intrinsic feature of H-mode operation in Tokamaks, runaway electrons pose a potential threat across all Tokamak device scales.In devices such as ITER, even with mitigation strategies, the ELMs can still impose considerable heat loads on the PFMs, reaching levels of approximately 1 MJ/m2. Various methods exist to experimentally simulate the heat load effects of ELMs on PFMs. In this study, the thermal loads from REs in small-scale Tokamaks are considered for this purpose.The presence of small-scale Tokamaks, exemplified by the Damavand experiment, facilitates the investigation of RE energy deposition. Analysis of the experimental data indicates that the REs populations generated by plasma instabilities within the Damavand Tokamak discharges exhibit heat densities on the order of MJ/m2 to 1 cm2 area PFMs. Furthermore, considering an average REs energy of 1 MeV and the prevailing discharge current, calculations indicate that the average total energy of the REs population per discharge is approximately 1 kJ, which is subsequently deposited on the Tokamak limiter. Considering the limiter's surface area and assuming that only 40% of the REs energy is transferred to it, the calculated heat load density reaches the order of MJ/m2, comparable to that observed during the ELMs events in large-scale fusion devices. This correspondence enables the Damavand Tokamak to investigate thermal loas effects of ELMs on PFMs in large-scale Tokamaks.",

Moreover, there are also other transient thermal loads occurring due to off-normal operation of ITER such as vertical displacement events or disruptions, at the orders of hundreds of MW/m2 and tens of GW/m2, respectively. These loads are great enough to result in severe damages of plasma-facing materials. In this study, the facture of tungsten material under the heat loads of Tokamaks is simulated and the results are presented.",

    "title": "An Interpretable Operator-Learning Model for Electric Field Profile Reconstruction in Discharges Based on the EFISH Method",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models have recently been used to reconstruct electric field distributions from EFISH signal profiles-the 'inverse EFISH problem'. This addresses the line-of-sight EFISH inaccuracy caused by the Gouy phase shift in focused beams. A key benefit of this approach is that the accuracy of the reconstructed profile can be directly checked via a 'forward transform' of the EFISH equation. Motivated by this latest success, the present study introduces a novel ML model with markedly improved performance. Based on a more powerful operator-learning architecture, it goes beyond the ANNs and CNNs employed previously. Termed Decoder-DeepONet (DDON), its main strength is learning function-to-function mappings, essential for recovering electric field profiles of unknown shape. The superior performance of DDON is exemplified via a comparison with our published CNN model and the feasibility of a classical mathematical method, as well as its application to both discharge simulations and experimental EFISH data from a nanosecond pulsed discharge. In almost all cases, the DDON model exhibits better generalizability, higher prediction accuracy, and wider applicability. Furthermore, the intrinsic nature of this operator-learning architecture renders it less sensitive to the exact location(s) of the acquired data, enabling electric field reconstruction even with seemingly 'incomplete' input profiles--an issue often accompanying poor signal sensitivity. We also employ Integrated Gradients (IG) to identify the signal regions most critical to reconstruction accuracy, providing guidance on the optimal sampling window for EFISH acquisition. Overall, we believe that the DDON model is a robust and comprehensive model which can be readily applied to reconstruct 'bell-shaped' electric field profiles with an existing axis of symmetry, especially in non-equilibrium plasmas.",
