  "title": "NeutrSHINE: a high repetition rate ultrafast neutron source driven by SHINE electron beam",
  "abstract": "Neutrons serve as unique probes for exploring the microscopic structure of matter, with the performance of a neutron source fundamentally governing the depth of scientific exploration and the breadth of industrial applicability. To address application demands including nuclear data measurement in the ultra-high-energy region, fundamental particle physics research, highly efficient non-destructive neutron testing, and extreme environment simulation, an ultrafast neutron source driven by the 8 GeV electron beam from the Shanghai high-repetition-rate extreme light facility (SHINE) was conceptually proposed, named NeutrSHINE. Using multidisciplinary simulation tools, key neutronic parameters, thermal behavior of high-power neutron targets, and the factors affecting the time resolution of the source were analyzed. The results affirm the technical feasibility and promising application prospects of the NeutrSHINE concept.",
