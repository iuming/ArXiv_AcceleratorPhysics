  "title": "The effect of Coulomb interactions on relic neutrino detection via beta decaying impurities in (semi)metals",
  "abstract": "Measuring the electron neutrino mass is a long-standing objective and requires a high energy resolution of certain $β$-decay experiments, as well as a visible cosmic neutrino background ($CνB$) spectrum. Many quantum mechanical and chemical effects could potentially impair the required resolution/visibility, e.g., the Coulomb interactions between the electrons in the \\b{eta}-decaying impurity and in the solid-state environment. We analyze the effect when hybridization is suppressed completely using a dielectric spacer, and also when hybridization is present up to the lowest nontrivial order in perturbation theory.",
