  "title": "Evaluation of CZT Detector Performance in Alpha and Gamma Spectrometry",
  "abstract": "Presented is a work on the performance studies of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) planar detector structures. Current-voltage (IV), capacitance-voltage (CV), and gamma- and alpha-spectroscopy measurements were carried out to provide the essential baseline required for forthcoming defect configuration impact studies on the detector spectroscopy performance. For each tested sensor, spectroscopic responses were recorded with several bias voltages applied. The described suite of measurements provides the parameters needed to evaluate, bulk resistivity, signal efficiency, and energy resolution for characteristic peaks at different energies. Readout configurations and data processing are discussed in related sections.",
