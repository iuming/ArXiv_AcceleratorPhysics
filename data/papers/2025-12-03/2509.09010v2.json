  "title": "Cryogenic geometric anti-spring vibration isolation system",
  "abstract": "The combination of low temperature and low vibration levels is key for ultrasensitive sensing applications such as scanning probe microscopy, large-mass quantum mechanics, and gravitational wave detection. Unfortunately, closed-cycle cryostats using pulse tube or GM coolers introduce strong low-frequency vibrations starting at 1 Hz. Mass-spring systems allow passive isolation, but for low-frequency applications the required spring constants and masses become impractical. Blade-based geometric anti-spring systems are compact isolators that operate from sub-Hz frequencies, but have not been demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we characterize a geometric anti-spring system tuned to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Our cryogenic filter uses radially arranged titanium blade springs whose effective spring constant can be tuned in-situ using a magnetic actuator. Our system achieves a vertical resonance frequency of 185 mHz at 7K, which allows reduction of vibrations at the problematic 1 Hz cooler frequency by an order of magnitude.",
