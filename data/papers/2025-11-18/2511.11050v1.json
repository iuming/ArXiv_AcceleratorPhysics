  "title": "Measurement of cosmic-ray muon flux at CJPL-II",
  "abstract": "In China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory globally, the cosmic-ray muon flux is significantly reduced due to the substantial shielding provided by the overlying mountain. From 2016 to 2020, we measured the muon flux in the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) with a plastic scintillator muon telescope system, detecting 161 muon events over an effective live time of 1098 days. The detection efficiency was obtained by simulating the underground muon energy and angular distributions and the telescope system's response to underground muons. The cosmic-ray muon flux is determined to be (3.03 $\\pm$ 0.24 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.18 (sys)) $\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is the lowest among underground laboratories worldwide.",
