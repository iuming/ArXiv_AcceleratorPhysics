  "title": "Demonstration that Differential Length Changes of Optical Cavities are a Sensitive Probe for Ultralight Dark Matter",
  "abstract": "Measurements of differential length oscillations of Fabry-Perot cavities provide a sensitive and promising approach to searching for scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM). The initial demonstration sets direct lower bounds that are one to two orders of magnitude lower for two model ULDM distributions -- a standard galactic halo and a relaxion star bound to Earth -- ranging over a decade of ULDM mass and Compton frequency. The demonstration suggests how a much higher sensitivity to a much larger ULDM mass range can be obtained.",
