    "title": "Prompt Gamma Timing in Carbon Therapy: First Experimental Results with the TIARA Detector",
    "abstract": "In the context of range monitoring for particle therapy, this study presents the first experimental results obtained with the TIARA detector using carbon-ion beams at the CNAO clinical center in Pavia, Italy. TIARA is based on the Prompt Gamma Timing (PGT) technique, which measures the time of flight (TOF) between incident ions and prompt gamma rays (PGs) emitted during nuclear interactions in the target. While the TIARA prototype has previously been validated with protons, carbons present a more challenging scenario due to their higher linear energy transfer, nuclear fragmentation products, and the continuous beam time structure of synchrotron accelerators. Experiments were performed by irradiating PMMA targets of different thicknesses with 200 MeV/u carbon beams. A coincidence time resolution of 279$\\pm$35 ps FWHM was achieved, outperforming results previously obtained with protons at the same facility. A range accuracy of 4.74$\\pm$0.36 mm at a 2$σ$ confidence level was measured at clinical intensity, when considering 5600 detected PGs, corresponding to the grouping of four irradiation spots of 2.4$\\cdot$10$^6$ ions each. Overall, the results demonstrate that PGT-based range monitoring remains viable for carbon-ion beams, although increased background from secondary protons indicates that detector configuration adaptations are required.",

    "title": "First Dark Photon Search Results from the Dandelion Experiment",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the first results from the Dandelion experiment, a directional detection, which searches for 1 meV dark photon dark matter. We use a spherical mirror to convert dark photons into standard millimeter-wavelength photons that can then be detected with an array of 221 Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) cooled down to 150 mK within the KISS (KIDs Interferometric Spectral Surveyor) camera and operating between 150 and 350 GHz. We used 1480 minutes of data to search for the signal of dark photons in the KID detectors, which is expected to be modulated due to the Earth's rotation. Our main challenge was to deal with a large background from room temperature and stray-light fluctuations. We used a de-correlation analysis to remove these background fluctuations. Templates of the background fluctuations were constructed from a Principal Component Analysis decomposition of detector measurements outside the expected Field of View trajectory of dark photons. We found that the dark photon signal was consistent with zero, giving a new upper limit on the dark photon's kinetic mixing, $χ$, with masses between 0.6 meV and 1.4 meV. These are the first constraints on dark photons as a dark matter candidate using an array of KIDs at millimeter wavelength.",

    "abstract": "To meet the stringent time calibration requirements for the Belle II experiment upgrade, particularly for its large-size KL and Muon Detector comprising tens of thousands of scintillator channels with time resolutions better than 100 ps, we developed a compact and high-speed time calibration system. The system utilizes a laser diode as its light source, integrated with a fast pulse laser drive circuit that employs high-speed switching GaN FETs and gate drivers. A prototype was constructed and rigorously evaluated using scintillators, achieving timing resolutions of about 13 ps for a single calibration channel. Furthermore, internal deviations among calibration channels were analyzed, with most measurements remaining within 250 ps. These results highlight the system's precision, scalability, and suitability for large-scale particle physics experiments.",

    "title": "Picosecond Precision Heavy Ion Detector for Λ Hypernuclei Lifetime Studies",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and preliminary performance evaluation of a new heavy ion detector for direct measurements of heavy Λ hypernuclei lifetime. The detector employs the previously developed 10 picosecond resolution Radio Frequency (RF) Timer, which converts the temporal information of incident particles into spatial coordinates of secondary or photoelectrons on a position-sensitive detector by means of circular RF scanning in the 500-1000 MHz range. Here, we report the detector design to achieve efficient suppression of accidental background and effective separation of prompt reaction products and delayed events from Λ hypernuclei decays, results of test studies carried out with RF synchronized laser as well as preliminary results obtained by using alpha particles. Dedicated Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed to estimate the detector's performance under realistic experimental conditions at RF-driven electron, photon, or proton beams. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed design and provide a basis for upcoming experimental measurements, based on the delayed fission detection.",

    "title": "Probing Internal Conversion and Dark-Matter-Induced De-excitation of 180mTa with a gamma-ray TES Array",
    "abstract": "We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\\mathrm{m}}\\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $γ$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3σ$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$ yr and $0.66$ yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.",

We address this problem using the mathematical framework of Optimal Transport (OT), which has been successfully employed for event classification in other HEP contexts and is ideally suited to the high-resolution calorimetry of LArTPCs. Using a publicly available simulated dataset from the MicroBooNE collaboration, we show that OT methods achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in $e/π^0$ classification.

    "title": "3D-Deuteron Track Recoils Produced by Neutron Capture in Hydrogen Measured by MIMAC-35 cm",
    "abstract": "The neutron capture is a process that concerns most of the nuclei used to build our detectors. This process produces protons, alpha particles, and gamma rays which generate background signals. Characterizing this background is important for rare event searches, such as dark matter detection or Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS). This paper presents the result of the direct measurement of thermal neutron captures in hydrogen using a new MIcro-TPC MAtrix Chamber (MIMAC-35 cm) detector with a sensitive volume of 35 x 35 x 29 cm3. Data were collected over more than 5 days (443519 sec) with a gas mixture at 30 mbar of 70% isobutane (C4H10) and 30% trifluoromethane (CHF3). Our discrimination method is based on using 3D tracks and released ionization energy, in order to discriminate nuclear recoils (NR) from the dominant electron recoil (ER) background. This method enables the clear identification of 1.3 keV deuteron tracks resulting of nuclear capture reaction 1H(n, γ)2H. We observed 51 neutron capture events among more than 11 million total events mainly produced by muons in the experimental room of our ground laboratory. In parallel we have measured the thermal neutron flux just below the chamber with a BF3 detector and a simulation has been performed to estimate the number of captures expected. This work shows the discrimination power of MIMAC search for low-energy (E < 1 keV) rare event with a huge background without any shielding.",

    "title": "Prediction of Spallation Induced Transmutation Rates For Long Lived Fission Products via Proton Accelerator",
    "abstract": "Long lived fission products represent a major challenge in nuclear waste management due to persistent radiotoxicity over very long timescales. This study focuses on six of these fission products: Se-79, Zr-93, Tc-99, Sn-126, I-127, Cs-135. This study investigates the feasibility of spallation driven transmutation, in which a high energy proton beam strikes a heavy spallation target to generate neutrons that induce transmutation in the fission products surrounding the target. Lead and depleted uranium are identified as the principal spallation target candidates, reflecting contrasting trade offs in neutron yield, secondary reactions, and heat generation. Simulations assess nuclide specific behavior under reactor scale inventories and practical geometric constraints. Results demonstrate that technetium, iodine, and selenium are strong candidates for transmutation using this pathway, while tin shows partial resistance but benefits from thermal flux. By contrast, zirconium is neutron transparent and inefficient to transmute, and cesium suffers from low net reduction due to competition with lighter isotopes. Cost effectiveness is highly isotope dependent: technetium is most favorable, whereas cesium and zirconium remain expensive. These findings highlight the advantages and limitations of spallation driven systems and motivate strategies with optimized target-blanket designs.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing compressible fluctuations in the solar wind is essential for understanding their role in solar wind acceleration and heating, yet their origin and evolution across different turbulence regimes remain poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a statistical analysis of the properties of compressible fluctuations in solar wind dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence. Using in-situ measurements from Wind, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe, we investigate the scale dependence of density and magnetic field fluctuations and their correlations with plasma beta and radial distance. Our results indicate that solar wind compressibility is likely affected by both expansion effects and compressible dynamics governed by local plasma conditions. The non-Alfvenic wind is dominated by anti-correlated fluctuations, whereas the Alfvenic wind contains a mixture of correlated and anti-correlated fluctuations, though the latter remain prevalent. While the anti-correlated component is consistent with MHD slow magnetosonic modes, the correlated (fast mode-like) component is not reproduced by predictions from either linear MHD theory or nonlinear models of forced compressible fluctuations. Nevertheless, the dominant slow mode component explains the observed dependence on beta and the enhanced density fluctuations measured by Parker Solar Probe. This further suggests that slow mode waves contribute significantly to the compressible energy budget near the Sun and may play an important role in solar wind heating and acceleration close to the Sun.",

    "abstract": "This position paper presents a vision for self-driving particle accelerators that operate autonomously with minimal human intervention. We propose that future facilities be designed through artificial intelligence (AI) co-design, where AI jointly optimizes the accelerator lattice, diagnostics, and science application from inception to maximize performance while enabling autonomous operation. Rather than retrofitting AI onto human-centric systems, we envision facilities designed from the ground up as AI-native platforms. We outline nine critical research thrusts spanning agentic control architectures, knowledge integration, adaptive learning, digital twins, health monitoring, safety frameworks, modular hardware design, multimodal data fusion, and cross-domain collaboration. This roadmap aims to guide the accelerator community toward a future where AI-driven design and operation deliver unprecedented science output and reliability.",

    "abstract": "Through 2D3V PIC simulations of freely decaying sub-ion turbulence, intermittent localized regions with $\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\neq 0$ are found to be statistically associated with reductions in the magnitude of magnetic helicity while evolving in the early electron-scale interaction phase. Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \\sim \\text{const}$. For initially net-helical configurations, we observe rapid development of mixed-signed magnetic helicity patches and a decrease of the global fractional helicity, such that the decay over the kinetic interval is again most consistent with the cancellation-dominated scaling constraint.",

    "abstract": "The use of gaseous Time Projection Chambers enables the detection and the detailed study of rare events due to particles interactions with the atoms of the gas with energy releases as low as a few keV. Due to this capability, these instruments are being developed for applications in the field of astroparticle physics, such as the study of dark matter and neutrinos. To readout events occurring in the sensitive volume with a high granularity, the CYGNO collaboration is developing a solution where the light generated during the avalanche processes occurring in a multiplication stage based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is read out by optical sensors with very high sensitivity and spatial resolution. To achieve a high light output, gas gain values of the order of $10^5\\text{-}10^6$ are needed. Experimentally, a dependence of the detector response on the spatial density of the charge collected in the GEM holes has been observed, indicating a gain-reduction effect likely caused by space-charge buildup within the multiplication channels. This paper presents data collected with a prototype featuring a sensitive volume of about two liters, together with a model developed by the collaboration to describe and predict the gain dependence on charge density. A comparison with experimental data shows that the model accurately reproduces the gain behaviour over nearly one order of magnitude, with a percent-level precision.",

    "abstract": "We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments. The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.",

    "title": "Tolerances to driver-witness misalignment in a quasilinear plasma wakefield accelerator",
    "abstract": "Plasma-based accelerators offer high accelerating gradients and scalability through staging or long plasma sources, which makes them good candidates for future accelerator and collider concepts. Proton-driven accelerators in particular have the potential to bring particles to high energy in a single stage. In the quasilinear regime - where the plasma wake is only partially evacuated - a witness bunch of electrons drives a cavitated wake, which acts to preserve the emittance of the portion of the witness inside this self-blowout. In the case of a misalignment between the driver and witness, this behaviour can persist, but its effectiveness is reduced. In this paper, we study transverse witness dynamics in this regime, and develop analytical models to describe the witness motion, and develop a metric to estimate emittance preservation based on a single parameter which estimates the density of the witness after phase mixing. Particle in cell simulations using the AWAKE Run 2c baseline parameters show excellent agreement with the predictive models developed. This work allows alignment constraints to be set both for the AWAKE experiment and other wakefield acceleration schemes operating in the quasilinear regime.",

    "title": "Self-Consistent Dynamics of Electron Radiation Reaction via Structure-Preserving Geometric Algorithms for Coupled Schrödinger-Maxwell Systems",
    "abstract": "Classically, a charged particle in a magnetic field emits radiation, losing momentum and experiencing the Abraham-Lorentz (AL) / Landau-Lifshitz (LL) radiation reaction (RR) force. However, at atomic scales and outside the range of their applicability, the AL/LL equations fail and RR destroys the coherent state of an electron-undermining the very concept of a RR force. This process can be described by the coupled Schrödinger-Maxwell (SM) system under appropriate limits, but the system's nonlinear complexity has long limited purely analytical studies. We present geometric structure-preserving algorithms for the SM system that preserve gauge invariance, symplecticity, and unitarity on the discrete space-time lattice, which are implemented in our Structure-Preserving scHrodINger maXwell (SPHINX) code. By constructing coherent states from the Landau levels, SPHINX simulates the fully-coupled nonlinear dynamics of an electron coherent state, the energy partition evolution, and decoherence/relaxation of the electron wave packet in time due to RR. These simulations indicate that, in an external magnetic field, an electron prepared in an atomic-scale coherent state can radiate strongly, rapidly losing coherence and dispersing into a decoherent wave packet. Additionally, we also present the fully-coupled nonlinear evolution of the non-degenerate ground- and first-excited Landau levels themselves to understand how the coupled SM system modifies the well-known ideal (i.e., Schrödinger-only) dynamics of the Landau Levels. With appropriate boundary conditions, simulations show that the Landau levels are renormalized into stationary dressed eigenstates with constant electromagnetic and kinetic energies. This opens a new computational window into RR physics and advances modeling of extreme-field phenomena in fusion plasmas, astrophysics, and next-generation laser experiments",

    "abstract": "Simulations and observations of the low-latitude magnetosphere-magnetosheath boundary layer indicate that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) drives vortex structures that enhance plasma mixing and magnetic reconnection, influencing transport and particle acceleration. We investigate the efficiency and physical mechanisms of plasma mixing driven by the nonlinear evolution of the KHI. We perform high-resolution two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations using a finite-Larmor-radius shear-flow initial configuration. Plasma mixing is quantified using particle tracking, passive tracers, and diagnostics of magnetic reconnection. Mixing across the shear layer is present but localized, occurring mainly in narrow interface regions and plasma structures. Ions mix more effectively than electrons, which remain largely frozen to field lines. Enhanced mixing correlates with localized reconnection within and between KH vortices. Cross-boundary transport driven by the kinetic KHI is highly localized and mediated by vortex advection and reconnection. Electron mixing is strongly constrained, providing an upper bound on kinetic-scale transport across collisionless shear layers.",

    "title": "Resistive instabilities of current sheets in stratified plasmas with a gravitational field",
    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection can develop spontaneously via the tearing instability, often invoked to explain disruptive instabilities in fusion devices, solar flares, the generation of periodic density disturbances at the tip of helmet streamers, and flux transfer events at the Earth's dayside magnetopause. However, in many such environments the presence of gravity, magnetic field curvature or other forms of acceleration often result in situations of a heavy-over-light plasma in an effective gravitational field with an embedded current sheet. This paper studies the linear stability of a slab current sheet with respect to reconnecting modes in the presence of a density gradient under the effect of a constant gravitational acceleration. We show that the presence of stratification and gravity modify the properties of the tearing mode instability both in the case of favorable and unfavorable stratification. Favorable stratification suppresses reconnection while unfavorable stratification strongly destabilizes the tearing mode. Furthermore, we show that the classical constant-ψ regime effectively does not exist, even for weak unfavorable stratification, for S>>1. Instead, the gravity-modified tearing progressively transitions into the G-mode, which is a gravity-driven reconnecting mode with a growth rate scaling as S^-1/3. As a consequence, unfavorable stratification only permits rapidly reconnecting modes.",

    "title": "Prospects for Direct Electron Detectors in Ultrafast Electron Scattering Experiments",
    "abstract": "Ultrafast electron diffraction and phonon-diffuse scattering (UED(S)) experiments make use of photo-induced changes to electron scattering intensity across 2D detectors to report on a very wide range of dynamic structural phenomena in molecules and materials. Compared to ultrafast spectroscopies, these techniques have very high structural-information content and competitive time-resolution, but sensitivity to relative changes in electron scattering intensity is orders of magnitude lower. Hybrid pixel counting detectors (HPCDs) are a promising technology for improved sensitivity and signal-to-noise in UED(S) experiments, as they offer near-zero readout noise and dark counts with the possibility of new acquisition modalities (e.g. shot-to-shot normalization) due to their high frame rates. However, it is well known that HPCDs suffer from count losses at high electron fluxes even in CW beam applications. How this translates to ultrashort electron pulse exposures has yet to be determined and is critical to understanding the application of this technology to ultrafast electron scattering experiments. Here we show that count losses are exacerbated significantly in ultrafast (pulsed) experiments and that HPCDs require count rates to be kept below $\\approx 2$ electrons per pixel per pulse. This count-rate limitation presents a severe constraint on electron bunch charge when interrogating single crystal samples. A model for the electron counting uncertainties in HPCDs across the entire relevant range of average count rates is proposed, from which we derive experimental strategies to optimize data quality in UEDS using direct electron detectors. Finally, we suggest ways HPCDs could be better adapted to ultrashort pulsed beam experiments.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic enhancement of symmetry-breaking effects in neutron-nucleus resonances provides a sensitive testing ground for Time-Reversal Invariance Violation (TRIV). Exploiting this mechanism, the Neutron Optics Parity and Time Reversal Experiment (NOPTREX) seeks to elucidate the origin of the universe's baryon asymmetry. Critical to this effort is the precise measurement of Parity Violation (PV) asymmetries, which is essential to calibrate the nuclear parameters required for future TRIV experiments. To facilitate these studies, we developed an eV polarized neutron at the Back-n white neutron beamline of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). Neutron polarization is generated by an in-situ Spin-Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP) $^3$He filter. Spin manipulation is performed by an adiabatic spin flipper, while spin polarization is preserved over the flight path by a vacuum transport system equipped with a solenoidal guide field. Experiments successfully measured an asymmetry of approximately $7.8 \\pm 2.4$ (stat.) $\\pm 0.3$ (sys.) % at the 0.747 eV p-wave resonance of $^{139}$La. These results are in agreement with previous results on this resonance and validate the system's capability for PV measurements.",

    "title": "Design and characterization of a photosensor system for the RELICS experiment",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a photosensor system developed for the RELICS experiment. An extended dynamic range base was designed to mitigate photomultiplier tube (PMT) saturation caused by intense cosmic muon backgrounds in the surface-level RELICS detector. The system employs dual readout from the anode and the seventh dynode to extend the linear response range of the PMT. In particular, our characterization and measurements of Hamamatsu R8520-406 PMTs confirm stable operation under positive high-voltage bias, extending the linear response range by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, a model of PMT saturation and recovery was developed to evaluate the influence of cosmic muon signals in the RELICS detector. The results demonstrate the system capability to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering signals under surface-level cosmic backgrounds, and suggest the potential to extend the scientific reach of RELICS to MeV-scale interactions.",

    "abstract": "This note is intended to provide an overview of the implications of regulations and standards on the safety of mechanical equipment, with a focus on accelerator components. Each research facility has different internal rules and standards which are applicable to specific cases; however, the main reference legal frame in Europe is everywhere based on the applicable European Directives. After a brief introduction to the 'safety' for mechanical systems, the process of 'risk analysis' will be introduced. The majority of this note will then deal with regulations and standards for pressure and cryogenic equipment. The European Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) will be briefly described, together with the concept of 'harmonized standards' and their implications on the entire lifecycle of a pressure equipment, with some hints at the peculiarities of accelerator components. In the second part of this note, regulations and standards for machinery, load-lifting accessories and buildings will be briefly mentioned to complete the picture of the most common cases in an accelerator facility.",

In spite of the long history of the study on the energy deposition of charged particles in materials, a full agreement between the measured results and theoretical predictions, especially in a low energy scale, are yet to be achieved. It is thus important to experimentally measure the ionization yields of recoil nuclei for the experiments with gaseous detectors using an ionization charge readout scheme. This study measured the ionization yield using a low-energy ion beam facility at Kanagawa University. The ionization yields for fluorine ions with an energy range of 5 $\\sim$ 50 keV were measured using a dedicated proportional wire chamber filled with $\\mathrm{CF}_{4}$ gas at 0.06 atm. The low-energy ion injection scheme into a gaseous detector was established and the ionization yield for fluorine ions was obtained to be 0.45 at 30 keV with a moderate dependence on the ion energy.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $α$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\\ell$ from the dirty limit $\\ell\\llξ_0$ to the clean limit $\\ell\\ggξ_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $α_{\\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $α$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \\gtrsim 0.5 Δ/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\\ell\\gtrsimξ_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $α_{\\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $α$ near $f\\simeq Δ/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.",

    "title": "Radiological mapping and uncertainty quantification by a fast Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo sampler",
    "abstract": "Radiological mapping plays a critical role in nuclear emergency response and environmental management activities. A radiation image, representing the spatial and intensity distribution of the radioactivity, is reconstructed from the radiation data and associated contextual information. Typical image reconstruction methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (ML-EM), only provide point estimates of the pixel or voxel activities without associated uncertainties. Here, we apply a new Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) sampler for radiation image reconstruction and uncertainty quantification. The MCLMC sampler properties are first tested with synthetic radiation images. Methods to obtain the radiation distribution estimate and the associated uncertainty from the samples drawn by MCLMC are discussed. Given sufficient measurement statistics, the radiation distribution estimate obtained from MCLMC results closely resembles the ground truth with less risk of over- or under-fitting compared to ML-EM. When MCLMC is run in parallel on a GPU, it can converge in about 10 seconds for an image with $10^3$--$10^4$ pixels, which is significantly faster than other comparable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. We also tested MCLMC on a dataset from a real distributed source radiological mapping campaign, and the reconstructed results agree well with ground truth. The fast MCLMC sampler therefore enables improved imaging accuracy and prompt uncertainty quantification for reconstructed radiation images, which can better inform decision-making in response to radiological events.",

    "title": "Capturing Secondary Kinetic Instabilities in Three-Dimensional Dayside Reconnection Using an Improved Gradient-Based Closure",
    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a highly dynamic process that excites a wide variety of kinetic waves and instabilities. Transverse current sheet instabilities such as the lower-hybrid drift and secondary drift-kink instabilities in particular have been shown by kinetic simulations to modify the reconnection and introduce significant turbulence and mixing to the reconnection layer. Past studies using the ten-moment fluid model to capture important kinetic physics such as the electron inertia and full representation of the pressure tensor proved advantageous to a two-fluid representation of reconnection, but the model struggled when using a local relaxation closure for the heat flux to replicate the current sheet instabilities and subsequent mixing seen in kinetic simulations. This work uses the \\texttt{Gkeyll} software framework to perform simulations of asymmetric reconnection based on the 16 October 2015 MMS crossing of a diffusion region, the Burch event. An improved gradient-based heat flux closure is implemented, showing significant improvement in secondary kinetic instabilities that grow in the current sheet. These instabilities generate turbulence which leads to growth of secondary magnetic islands and flux ropes.",

    "abstract": "A theory of the spectral \"zebra\" pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the use of extended phase-space symplectic integration for simulating two different classes of electron dynamics. The first one, with one and a half degrees of freedom, comes from plasma physics and describes the classical dynamics of a charged particle in a strong, constant, and uniform magnetic field perturbed by a turbulent electrostatic potential. The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations. Our work paves the way for broad application of symplectic split-operator integration of classical and quantum Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom by comparing different modes of implementation of extended phase space integration.",

    "title": "Numerical study of electron acceleration by microwave-driven plasma wakefields in rectangular waveguides",
    "abstract": "Plasma-based acceleration schemes have attracted sustained interest as a pathway toward compact particle accelerators, owing to the large electric fields supported by plasmas. Although recent studies have demonstrated the excitation of plasma wakefields using high-power microwave pulses in plasma-filled waveguides, the conditions required for efficient electron acceleration in such configurations remain insufficiently characterized. In this work, we investigate the acceleration of externally injected electrons by microwave-driven plasma wakefields in rectangular waveguides filled with low-density plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are employed to analyze the dynamics of electron injection and energy gain under both reduced and fully self-consistent numerical models. The results show that electron acceleration is strongly dependent on the injection phase and initial velocity. Optimal acceleration is achieved when electrons are pre-accelerated to velocities close to the group velocity of the driving microwave pulse. For the parameters considered, energy gains of the order of $10^2 \\mathrm{keV}$ are obtained over interaction lengths of the order of meters, while maintaining a quasi-monoenergetic energy distribution under suitable injection conditions. The influence of transverse dynamics and space-charge effects is also examined, revealing additional constraints on acceleration efficiency associated with the transverse electromagnetic field of the driving microwave pulse. These results provide a quantitative assessment of the acceleration stage in microwave-driven plasma wakefield schemes and support their evaluation as a viable platform for compact plasma-based accelerators.",

    "abstract": "Hard x-ray emission, associated with hot electron preheat, in direct-drive implosions was observed to be enhanced by a factor of $1.5\\pm0.1$ by application of a $10$ T magnetic field. The applied magnetic field reaches a quasi steady-state aligned with the ablation flow prior to the onset of laser-plasma instabilities in the corona. Hot electrons that would otherwise escape the corona and lead to capsule charging in unmagnetized implosions are confined in a mirror-mode of the magnetic field in magnetized implosions. These hot electrons are shown to subsequently pitch-angle scatter from the mirror onto the capsule, thereby leading to the observed hard x-ray generation in magnetized implosions. Consequently, the energy of charged-fusion products, associated with the capsule charging, are observed to decrease when the implosion is magnetized. These results intensify the need to mitigate laser-plasma instabilities -- particularly for magnetized implosions -- to maximize fusion gain and implosion efficiency.",

    "title": "Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED",
    "abstract": "QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\\textemdash Schrödinger versus Heisenberg\\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.",

    "title": "Nonlinear Frequency Shifts due to Phase Coherent Interactions in Incompressible Hall MHD Turbulence",
    "abstract": "Turbulence in the magnetized plasma is well understood to be the consequence of wave interactions. When the Hall effect is added to the minimum magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the MHD waves become dispersive and different nonlinear interactions are expected. The emergent turbulent state will thus be expected to be different. For incompressible Hall MHD we develop a reduced model for wave-wave interactions concentrating on those processes that will lead to phase coherent modifications to the linear dispersion of a given wave. We show that these special interactions provide an amplitude-dependent contribution to the linear dispersion relation, which yields nonlinear frequency shifts. The resonance-driven frequency shifts are dominant and add damping or growth to the linear dispersion. The damping/growth rates represent the nonlinear time scales for energy redistribution and can be used in conjunction with a conjecture like the \"critical balance\" to estimate the energy spectral content.",

    "title": "Operational measurement of relativistic equilibrium from stochastic fields alone",
    "abstract": "Relativistic equilibrium is described by the inverse-temperature four-vector $β^μ= u^μ/(k_B T_0)$ rather than by a frame-dependent scalar temperature. We show that $β^μ$ can be reconstructed directly from electromagnetic fluctuations emitted by a drifting medium, without external probes, spectral lines, or absolute intensity calibration. A Lorentz boost converts isotropic rest-frame noise into correlated electric and magnetic fields, producing a gain-independent fluctuation observable that yields the drift velocity purely from stochastic data. Combined with angle-resolved noise spectra governed by the covariant fluctuation--dissipation theorem, this enables full reconstruction of $β^μ$ using electromagnetic measurements alone. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios, and feasibility estimates indicate sub-microsecond integration times for laboratory plasmas. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first method that reconstructs the covariant thermal state $β^μ$ of a relativistic medium from passive stochastic fields alone, without absolute calibration, spectral lines, or external probes. These results establish vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations as a direct operational probe of relativistic equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "The self-modulation (SM) instability transforms a long charged particle bunch traveling in plasma into a train of microbunches that resonantly drives large-amplitude wakefields. We present the first determination of the saturation length of SM using experimental and numerical results. The saturation length is the distance over which wakefields reach their maximum amplitude along the plasma. By varying the plasma length and measuring the radius of the transverse distribution of the bunch, we find that the saturation length of SM decreases with plasma density and initial field amplitude, e.g., when seeding. The saturation length is a fundamental parameter of the instability, and these results are key for understanding SM and designing plasma wakefield accelerators driven by long bunches, such as AWAKE, or by long laser pulses for radiation production.",

    "title": "Scattering and sputtering on the lunar surface; Insights from negative ions observed at the surface",
    "abstract": "Context. Airless planetary bodies are directly exposed to solar wind ions, which can scatter or become implanted upon impact with the regolith-covered surface, while also sputtering surface atoms.   Aims. We construct a semi-analytical model for the scattering of ions of hundreds of eV and the sputtering of surface atoms, both resulting in the emission of negative ions from the lunar surface. Our model contains a novel description of the scattering process that is physics-based and constrained by observations.   Methods. We use data from the Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) instrument on the Chang'e-6 lander to update prior knowledge of ion scattering and sputtering from lunar regolith through Bayesian inference.   Results. Our model shows good agreement with the NILS data. A precipitating solar wind proton has roughly a 22% chance of scattering from the lunar surface in any charge state, and about an 8% chance of sputtering a surface hydrogen atom. The resulting ratio of scattered to sputtered hydrogen flux is eta_sc / eta_sp = 1.5 for a proton speed of 300 km/s. We find a high probability (7-20%) that a hydrogen atom leaves the surface negatively charged. The angular emission distributions at near-grazing angles for both scattered and sputtered fluxes are controlled by surface roughness. Our model also indicates significant inelastic energy losses for hydrogen interacting with the regolith, suggesting a longer effective path length than previously assumed. Finally, we estimate a surface binding energy of 5.5 eV, consistent with the observations.   Conclusions. Our model describes the scattering and sputtering of particles of any charge state from any homogeneous, multi-species surface. Using NILS data, we successfully applied the model to update our understanding of solar wind interacting with lunar regolith, and the emission of negative hydrogen ions.",

    "title": "Low dose gamma irradiation study of ATLAS ITk MD8 diodes",
    "abstract": "Silicon strip detectors developed for the Inner Tracker (ITk) of the ATLAS experiment will operate in a harsh radiation environment of the HL-LHC accelerator. The ITk is thus designed to endure a total fluence of 1.6E15 1MeV n_eq/cm2 and a total ionizing dose (TID) of 66 Mrad in the strip detector region. A radiation-hard n^+-in-p technology is implemented in the ITk strip sensors. To achieve the required radiation hardness, extensive irradiation studies were conducted during sensor development, primarily performed up to the maximal expected total fluence and TID to ensure a full functionality of the detector at its end-of-life. These studies included irradiations of sensors with various particle types and energies, including the Co60 gamma-rays. Our previous results obtained for gamma-irradiated diodes and strip sensors indicate a linear increase of bulk current with TID, while the surface current saturates at the lowest TID levels checked (66 Mrad), preventing a determination of the exact TID for which the observed saturation occurs. This work presents the results coming from irradiations by Co60 gamma-rays to multiple low TIDs, ranging from 0.5 to 100 krad. The detailed study of total, bulk, and surface currents of diodes explores an unknown dependence of surface current on the TID, annealing, and temperature. Additionally, the effect of the p-stop implant between the bias and the guard ring of measured samples is shown. The observations are relevant for the initial operations of the new ATLAS tracker.",

Magnetic-field amplification due to a beam-plasma instability was diagnosed using a high-sensitivity Faraday-rotation probe, supported by detailed characterization of the diagnostic impulse response.

    "title": "Thermal Decoherence and Population Transfer of MeV Channeling Electrons in Diamond",
    "abstract": "Channeling radiation in oriented crystals arises from transitions between quantized transverse bound states in the MeV regime and is strongly affected by thermal diffuse scattering through population transfer and decoherence. A frozen-phonon multislice propagation framework is developed to track a reduced transverse Hilbert space spanned by selected bound-state manifolds using configuration-resolved projection amplitudes. Beyond reproducing transition energies, the method yields reduced manifold density matrices, thermal population kinetics, and depth-resolved coherence metrics. Applied to axial electron channeling in $\\langle100\\rangle$ diamond at 16.9 MeV, the results show approximately exponential population loss with strongly state-dependent feeding among low-lying manifolds. For an initial coherent superposition in the degenerate 2p manifold, the intra-manifold purity relaxes toward the maximally mixed limit, consistent with thermally induced random basis rotations. Under 1s initial excitation, population transferred into the 2p and 3d manifolds remains close to maximally mixed, while weak cross-manifold coherences persist. The framework enables quantitative analysis of thermal population dynamics, decoherence, and their links to spontaneous and coherently driven emission observables across a broad range of crystal structures.",

In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.",

One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.",

The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\\bm{\\cos^n(θ)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\\bm{n = 1.44 \\pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values.

    "title": "Reinterpreting the sunward electron deficit: Implications for solar wind acceleration and core population formation",
    "abstract": "This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons.",

    "title": "Melting Coulomb clusters through nonreciprocity-enhanced parametric pumping",
    "abstract": "Complex systems out of equilibrium often experience intermittent oscillations between quiescent and highly dynamic states. The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.",
