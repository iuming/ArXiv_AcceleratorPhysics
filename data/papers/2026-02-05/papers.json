    "title": "Doberman: a modular and distributed slow control system for small- to medium-scale experiments",
    "abstract": "We present Doberman (Detector OBsERving and Monitoring ApplicatioN), a lightweight, modular, and open-source slow control system designed for small-to medium-scale physics experiments. Doberman addresses the gap between heavyweight industrial SCADA frameworks and ad hoc laboratory solutions by providing a flexible software architecture that supports heterogeneous instrumentation, distributed deployment, automated control, and robust alarm handling. The web-based graphical user interface Doberview provides live and continuously updated visualization, configuration, and control of the entire experiment, supporting both routine operation and rapid response to exceptional conditions. Doberman has been deployed and validated in multiple experimental setups, ranging from a remotely operated underground gamma-ray spectrometer to a large, highly instrumented liquid xenon test facility with several hundred monitored quantities.   Doberman and Doberview are released under permissive open-source licenses, and the software, documentation, and example device integrations are publicly available.",

    "title": "PhoQuPy: A Python framework for Automation of Quantum Optics experiments",
    "abstract": "We present the automation of a confocal photoluminescence (PL) scanning system for the identification and characterization of single-photon emitters (SPEs) in quantum materials. The setup excites the sample with a laser and acquires a spectrum at each spatial coordinate in a raster scan pattern. A double-acquisition method is used to remove cosmic ray artifacts by comparing subsequent measurements at the same spatial coordinate. Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission. The system integrates Python-based hardware control for motorized stages, spectrometer acquisition, and post-processing, with a migration to a galvo-mirror scanning approach for using it along with a cryostat for low temperature measurements. Our results demonstrate spatially resolved PL maps and temperature-dependent spectra, highlighting the capability of the setup to efficiently benchmark SPE performance. We further went on to perform automation of other experiments such as a Non-Linear Interferometry setup for Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and a Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy using a common path birefringence Interferometer to obtain hyperspectral images of our samples.",

    "title": "Data sorting modes of phoswich detector array",
    "abstract": "The different data-sorting modes of the phoswich detector array PARIS used for detecting high-energy (4$-$10 MeV) $γ$ rays are investigated. The characteristics including time resolution, energy resolution and detection efficiency under various modes are studied. The present study shows that PARIS has capabilities of rejecting escape and pileup events when used for decay spectroscopy. Notably, the methods presented in this work refer specifically to the $β$-decay experiment of $^{80g+m}$Ga conducted with three PARIS clusters comprising 27 phoswich detectors, rather than to a general report on the PARIS array or its overall performance for in-beam spectroscopy. Compared with the 2\"$\\times$2\"$\\times$2\" LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector (Ciemała et al., 2009), even in individual mode, PARIS provides significant suppression of single- and double-escape peaks and reduces background via vetoing function of the outer-volume NaI(Tl) crystals. In contrast to the common approach of adding back the energies in LaBr$_3$(Ce) and NaI(Tl) to increase the detection efficiency of the full-energy peak, using NaI(Tl) as a veto shield provides a superior trade-off for applications where spectral purity is essential. Employing add-back analysis within each cluster of nine phoswiches or between all phoswiches could enhance full-energy peak efficiency and further suppress escape peaks and background. Applying a multiplicity condition provides a further suppression but simultaneously lowers the statistics of full-energy peaks.",

    "title": "Experimental evidence of production of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator",
    "abstract": "We report on experimental evidence of the generation of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator driven by a PW-class laser. The muons were generated following the interaction of a GeV-scale high-charge electron beam with a 2cm-thick Pb target and were detected using a Timepix3 detector placed behind a suitable shielding configuration. Data analysis indicates a $(99.1\\pm0.5)$% confidence of muon detection over noise, in excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Extrapolation of the experimental setup to higher electron energies and charges suggests the potential to guide and separate from noise approximately $10^4$ muons/s onto cm$^2$-scale areas for applications using a 10 Hz PW laser. These results demonstrate the possibility of generating and transporting directional muon beams using high-power lasers and establish a foundation for the systematic application of laser-driven high-energy muon beams.",

    "title": "Passive Incoherent Ultrafast Mid-Infrared Upconversion Imaging and Its Calibration",
    "abstract": "Ultrafast mid-infrared (MIR) imaging is a key enabling capability for monitoring transient thermal and plasma phenomena in scientific diagnostics and industrial safety. However, conventional cryogenic MIR cameras face a fundamental trade-off between frame rate, noise, and pixel format. Here we report a passive, incoherent MIR imaging platform that leverages sum-frequency upconversion in chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPLN) to translate broadband 3--5um scenes to the near-infrared, enabling ultrafast acquisition on a silicon-based intensified CCD (iCCD). In fast-kinetics mode we achieve a physical frame rate of 100kHz with microsecond-scale gate control, and we directly capture the full evolution of an air-breakdown electric arc, resolving its rapid ignition, expansion, and decay dynamics. Beyond demonstrating ultrafast passive imaging, we introduce a drift-aware calibration workflow based on Allan deviation analysis to quantitatively select the gate width and averaging strategy under realistic slow-drift and multiplicative noise. This combined capability -- ultrafast passive MIR imaging plus operationally meaningful calibration -- provides a practical route toward real-time thermal surveillance and early-warning systems for hazardous fast transients.",

    "title": "A Pathway to Sub-meV Detection of the Dark Universe: Robust Electron Avalanche in the PN junction at 10 mK",
    "abstract": "The search for light dark matter and cosmic primordial neutrinos necessitates detectors with sub-millielectronvolt (sub-meV) energy thresholds. While superconducting quantum sensors have approached this sensitivity, they often face significant challenges regarding readout complexity and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid Superconductor-Insulator-P-N (S-I-P-N) detector architecture. This concept combines the high sensitivity of superconducting Cooper pair breaking with the massive intrinsic gain of semiconductor electron avalanches. A critical prerequisite for this scheme is operation at millikelvin (mK) temperatures, raising the critical fundamental question of whether silicon PN junctions can sustain avalanche multiplication in a regime where carrier freeze-out is severe. Here, we experimentally validate the critical semiconductor amplification stage of the proposed detector. We demonstrate that Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) retain robust Geiger-mode avalanche capabilities at 10 mK. We report a single-photoelectron gain of order 10$^6$ and a dark count rate as low as 5~mHz/mm$^2$, 7 orders of magnitude lower than at room temperature. These results confirm the viability of high-gain semiconductor readout in the deep cryogenic regime, clearing the primary obstacle regarding the semiconductor component for the realization of scalable, sub-meV threshold S-I-P-N detectors.",

An aluminum mockup cavity, replicating a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity geometry, was utilized to optimize deposition parameters, resulting in co-sputtered Nb-Sn films with Sn content of 32 - 42 at. % on the beam tubes and equator positions. Several annealing conditions were investigated to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn film. The best co-sputtered Nb-Sn film was achieved after annealing at 600 C for 6 h, followed by annealing at 950 C for 1 h. The best process was applied to a Nb cavity, which was RF tested in a cryogenic dewar. RF testing of the Nb3Sn-coated cavity demonstrated a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) close to the highest reported, at 17.78 K. The Nb3Sn cavity underwent a light Sn recoating process, followed by additional RF testing, resulting in enhancement of the RF performance, primarily due to improved surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn coating.",

    "abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) started the Run 3 operation in 2022, and the peak instantaneous luminosity in Run 3 may reach 3 x 10^34 cm-2s-1. The ATLAS Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers are the main component of the precision tracking system in the ATLAS muon spectrometer. It is important to understand any potential issues with the MDT Front-End (FE) readout electronics for an expected level-1 (L1) trigger rate of 100 kHz and a complex deadtime of over 5% for Run 3 operations. We use raw data collected in 2022 to emulate the expected hit rates in MDT chambers and perform a realistic simulation on the ATLAS Muon TDC (Time-to-Digital Converter) (AMT) chip with the current configuration. We study the AMT chip performances by analyzing the trigger/L1/readout buffer occupancies and hit loss fractions under different luminosities with L1 rate of 100 kHz by using the Modelsim software. The hit loss fraction of the hottest MDT chamber (BIL3C05) is lower than 5% due to FE readout, even at a luminosity of 5.01 x 10^34 cm-2s-1 with a deadtime of 5% and a L1 rate of 100 kHz, indicating that AMT can operate under Run 3 conditions without problems. The MDT trigger and readout electronics will be replaced for triggerless readout during High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) runs. We also simulate the AMT behavior in the triggerless mode up to 7.44 x 10^34 cm-2s-1 and propose possible AMT configurations in case some FE electronics could not be replaced during the long shutdown 3 (LS3).",

    "abstract": "A high-order piecewise field-aligned triangular finite element method is developed and implemented for global electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle-in-cell simulations of tokamak plasmas with open field lines. The approach combines locally field-aligned finite element basis functions with unstructured $C^{1}$ triangular meshes in cylindrical coordinates, enabling whole-volume simulations with substantially reduced computational effort, while avoiding the grid distortion associated with globally field-aligned coordinates and the associated singularity at the separatrix of diverted plasmas. The formulation is compatible with both $δf$ and full-$f$ models and employs mixed-variable representations, along with a generalized pullback scheme, to control numerical cancellation in electromagnetic simulations. The method is implemented in the TRIMEG-C1 code and demonstrated using linear and nonlinear electromagnetic simulations of the TCV-X21 configuration. The results indicate that the approach accurately captures the key features of electromagnetic ion-temperature-gradient and kinetic ballooning mode physics, including the separatrix regions in the simulation, thereby providing a robust framework for whole-volume electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations in realistic tokamak geometries.",

    "abstract": "Plasma wakefield acceleration is a groundbreaking technique for accelerating particles, capable of sustaining gigavolt-per-meter accelerating fields. Understanding the physical mechanisms governing the recovery of plasma accelerating properties over time is essential for successfully achieving high-repetition-rate plasma acceleration, a key requirement for applicability in both research and commercial settings. In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the early-stage plasma evolution based on the parameters of the SPARC_LAB hydrogen plasma recovery time experiment (Pompili et al., Comm. Phys. 7, 241 (2024)), employing spatially resolved Particle-in-Cell and fluid models. The experiment reports on a non-monotonic dependence of the plasma recovery time on the initial plasma density, an effect for which ion motion has been invoked as a contributing factor. The simulations presented here provide further insight into the role of ion dynamics in shaping this behavior. Furthermore, comparing Particle-in-Cell and fluid approaches allows us to assess the quality of fluid models for describing this class of plasma dynamics.",

    "title": "Self ordering to imposed ordering of dust -- a continuous spatial phase transition experiment in MDPX",
    "abstract": "Previous experiments conducted in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX) revealed an intriguing phenomenon first referred to as imposed ordering. This occurs when micron-sized dust particles become aligned with the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above the dust (at a distance much larger than the plasma Debye length or the ion-neutral or electron-neutral mean free paths) in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the mesh. In this work, results of a transition experiment are presented wherein starting from a classical two-dimensional Coulomb crystal with hexagonal symmetry in an unmagnetized plasma $(B = 0\\,T)$, dust transitions to a state in which it flows along the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above it, mapping out the 4-fold symmetry of the boundary condition. It is hypothesized that beyond a certain magnetization, elongated electric potential structures emanating from the mesh drive the dust motion to reflect the mesh morphology, transitioning from a 6-fold self ordering to 4-fold imposed ordering. The various dust phases are quantified and a critical value of magnetic field is identified in the transition experiment indicating the onset of imposed ordering.",

Both devices employ \\emph{thin} amorphous-germanium (a-Ge) dual-blocking contacts, implemented here for the first time on ICPC detectors, to provide bipolar charge blocking while limiting dead-layer thickness. Electrical tests at 76~K demonstrate stable operation with picoampere-level leakage currents and sub-pF capacitance: SAP17 reached $\\sim 4.62$~pA at the maximum tested bias (500~V) and operated stably at 400~V with $C\\simeq 0.503$~pF. \\emph{Meanwhile,} SAP16 achieved superior spectroscopic performance, with energy resolutions of 2.42\\% at 59.5~keV and 0.36\\% at 662~keV. Gamma-ray spectroscopy with $^{241}$Am and $^{137}$Cs shows that modest geometric differences lead to measurable changes in depletion behavior and charge-collection uniformity, consistent with electrostatic modeling. Angular-response measurements further reveal pronounced directional sensitivity at 59.5~keV, whereas the 662~keV response is essentially isotropic over the measured range. These results validate thin a-Ge dual-blocking contacts for ICPC HPGe detectors and highlight geometry-driven trade-offs among leakage current, depletion, and energy resolution relevant to low-background and low-threshold applications.",

Tin plasmas are generated by irradiating a continuously moving tin-coated wire with laser pulses (1064 nm, 10 ns, up to $5.7\\times10^{10}$ W/cm$^2$) and probed via coherent Thomson scattering, laser interferometry, and EUV emission spectroscopy. Thomson scattering measurements reveal electron temperatures and densities that decay with distance from the target. Densities derived from Thomson scattering are cross-validated against laser interferometry, showing excellent agreement. Correlating the results of these laser diagnostics with spatially resolved EUV spectroscopy suggests that the bulk of useful EUV emission originates within 150 $μ$m of the target and is generated under suboptimal plasma conditions. This work demonstrates a practical integrated approach for plasma characterization in EUV source development.",

    "title": "The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model",
    "abstract": "We derive the hot-electron-limit (HEL) closure for the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, known as the gyromoment (GM) approach. By expanding the gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio limit, τ = Ti/Te << 1, and retaining only the essential O(τ) terms, we obtain a closed system for the density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In a Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with the HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low collisionality dynamics. An extension to the tokamak-relevant s-α geometry and a comparison with gyrokinetic simulations reveal the capabilities and limitations of the HEL-closed GM model: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at τ=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents an accurate prediction of the Dimits shift and of transport suppression.",

    "title": "Towards fully predictive gyrokinetic full-f simulations: validation and triangularity studies in TCV",
    "abstract": "Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \\times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.",

    "abstract": "Collisionless Larmor coupling is a fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that enables momentum transfer between an expanding plasma and a magnetized ambient medium. In this paper, we report on the laboratory experimental study of Larmor coupling leading to the formation of a plasma blob associated with a laser-driven, super-Alfvénic plasma flow on the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. The high-repetition rate enables systematic spatial and temporal scans of the plasma evolution using Doppler spectroscopy, as well as measurements of the magnetic field, electrostatic field, and self-emission of both debris and ambient ions using filtered imaging. We observe the self-focusing of the laser-produced plasma and the formation of a secondary diamagnetic cavity associated with a blob composed of background ions. Doppler spectroscopy reveals the transverse velocity distribution of the background ions, providing direct evidence of ion energization via Larmor coupling. The systematic spatial and temporal scans enabled by the high-repetition rate experiment allow for a detailed characterization of the ion dynamics. These experimental observations are supported by numerical simulations that provide more insight into the kinetic-scale physics associated with blob formation as well as the role of the ambient plasma density.",

    "title": "Hydrodynamic simulations of expanded warm dense foil heated by pulsed-power",
    "abstract": "Warm Dense Matter lies at the frontier between condensed matter and plasma, and plays a central role in various fields ranging from planetary science to inertial confinement fusion. Improving our understanding of this regime requires experimental data that can be directly compared with theoretical and numerical models over a broad range of conditions. In this work, a pulsed-power experiment is described in which thin metallic foils, confined within a sapphire cell, are Joule-heated to achieve the expanded warm dense matter regime. Designing such an experiment is challenging, as it requires simultaneously predicting the electrical response of the pulsed-power driver and the hydrodynamic evolution of the heated material. To tackle this challenge, a modeling framework has been developed that couples an electrical description of the pulsed-power system, including the driver, the switching stages and the load with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code. This coupling allows the electrical energy deposition and the load thermodynamic evolution to be consistently linked through the material electrical conductivity. This approach takes advantage of the simplicity of a 1D geometry while retaining the essential physics and allowing to reproduce various measurements with good accuracy, such as expansion velocity, current and voltage. This numerical approach therefore constitutes a robust and efficient method for designing and optimizing future Warm Dense Matter experiments using pulsed-power facilities.",

To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.   We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\\,μ\\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\\,μ\\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\\,μ\\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\\,μ\\text{m}$.   Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic islands play a crucial role in regulating plasma confinement in tokamaks by interacting with micro-instabilities, such as the ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode. This work presents a detailed investigation of the effects of static magnetic islands on ITG instability, relevant to the ADITYA-U tokamak, using the Global Gyrokinetic Code in Cylindrical Coordinates (G2C3), a particle-in-cell (PIC) framework that employs a neural-network-assisted projection scheme. A two-phase simulation strategy is adopted. In the first phase, static magnetic islands with mode numbers (m, n) = (2, 1) and (3, 1) are introduced by perturbing the equilibrium magnetic flux functions. Particle dynamics within these modified topologies result in the flattening of plasma density profiles in the island regions, confirming island formation and its impact on the equilibrium profiles. In the second phase, the flattened profiles serve as new equilibria for linear electrostatic gyrokinetic simulations with adiabatic electrons, enabling the study of the modified ITG behavior. Magnetic islands significantly restructure the ITG mode, producing a spatial redistribution of potential fluctuations within and around the island region. Moreover, as the island width increases, the growth rates of different toroidal ITG modes converge, suggesting a universal stabilization trend. A comparison between the (2,1) and (3,1) islands indicates that higher-q islands lead to a more spatially extended ITG mode structure, reflecting the longer magnetic connection lengths and weaker curvature drive at outer flux surfaces. These results demonstrate the pivotal role of island-induced equilibrium modifications in determining ITG stability and mode structure in tokamak plasmas.",

    "title": "Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems",
    "abstract": "A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.",

    "abstract": "A novel concept for electroluminescence (EL) structures was recently proposed. In it, a wavelength-shifting material is deposited inside the holes of GEM-like structures which, after suitable optical treatment of its electrodes, improves the light collection and detection efficiency in noble gas TPCs. This new development directly addresses problems related with the scalability of future dual-phase TPCs for rare-event searches, matching (and potentially exceeding) the performance of conventional EL techniques.   We report the newest developments on the production of such structures using laser-based techniques, namely the manufacture of a first batch of the so-called FAT-GEMs. This process allows low-cost and reproducible manufacturing of a high volume of such structures.   In addition to the detailed description of the production, we present a performance assessment in pure argon, at a gas density close to the one expected in LAr conditions. An energy resolution of 23.5$\\pm$1~\\% (FWHM) at 5.9~keV was obtained, indicating a consistent improvement over previous batch. The optical treatment of the electrode surfaces has been greatly simplified and modestly improved, while charging-up effects arising from the use of laminates eliminated.",

    "title": "First Experimental Demonstration of Beam Storage by Three-Dimensional Spiral Injection Scheme for Ultra-Compact Storage Rings",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional spiral injection scheme enables storage in ultra-compact rings with nanosecond revolution period. We report the first successful storage of a $297\\,\\mathrm{keV/}c$ electron beam in a $22\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ weak-focusing storage ring with a $4.7\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ revolution period using multi-turn vertical kick with a $140\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ kicker pulse. Using a scintillating-fiber detector, we observe a signal exceeding $5σ$ of the pre-injection rms noise for $\\geq 1\\,\\mathrm{μs}$, confirming beam storage. By varying the weak-focusing field configuration and measuring the stored beam distribution, we show that the storage beam resides within the predicted region by Monte Carlo simulations. This result is a key proof-of-principle for realizing ultra-compact storage rings for next-generation precision measurements including the muon experiments at J-PARC and PSI.",

    "abstract": "Despite the successful demonstration of compact free electron lasers (FELs) driven by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs), the inherent shot-to-shot fluctuations in LWFAs, including both laser and plasma instabilities, remain a primary obstacle to realizing LWFA-driven FELs with robust operation. Here, we present a conceptual design for LWFA-driven FELs with sufficient tolerance against shot-to-shot fluctuations using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Start-to-end simulations demonstrated that this systematic optimization resulted in a significant improvement in the robustness of FELs. With the optimized configurations, the radiation energy can be maintained above 1 microjoule at a wavelength of approximately 25 nm, even when accounting for twice the root-mean-square (RMS) ranges of these instabilities. This proposed scheme represents a substantial advancement in the development of compact LWFA-driven FEL systems, enabling robust operation and paving the way for the realization of reliable and widely accessible sources.",

    "title": "Integrated Sliding-Short/Probe Tuner with Doorknob Transition for High-Q Cavities",
    "abstract": "We present an integrated three-knob tuner that internalizes impedance matching inside the launch adapter of a waveguide-fed, high-$Q$ cavity. The tuner combines a waveguide sliding short, a doorknob transition, and a micrometer-driven adjustable coaxial probe. A transmission-line/ABCD model is derived that maps the three mechanical degrees of freedom to the electrical objectives $Γ\\rightarrow 0$, $β$, and $Q_{\\rm L}$, explicitly including the fused-silica feedthrough capacitance. The model yields closed-form matching conditions and predicts the critical-coupling set. Full-wave FEM simulations and bench measurements validate the approach: with $h \\approx 0.55$~mm and backshort distance $\\approx 0.80$~mm, the return loss reaches $|S_{11}| \\approx -30$~dB near 17.8--18.1~GHz while sustaining peak electric fields of $\\sim 1.8 \\times 10^5$~V/m at the nozzle (normalized to 1~W). The measured through loss of the launch assembly is $|S_{21}| \\approx 0.7$--$0.8$~dB at resonance.   A parametric study shows that backshort lengths $L_{\\rm {bs}} \\geq 0.5 λ_{\\rm g}$ excite a parasitic stub resonance, introducing a second $S_{11}$ minimum and localizing energy behind the doorknob; keeping $L_{\\rm {bs}} \\leq 0.4 λ_g$ avoids this. In helium plasma discharges at $P_{\\rm {in}} = 10$~W, \\textit{in-situ} retuning of the short and probe maintained a favorable match as the plasma impedance evolved, increasing absorbed power from $\\sim 43\\%$ to $\\sim 76\\%$ while increasing helium propellant flow rate from 25 to 351~sccm. The compact tuner eliminates external stub boxes and generalizes to other waveguide-coupled resonators and plasma sources.",

    "title": "Angular momentum dynamics of vortex particles in accelerators",
    "abstract": "Experiments with spin-polarized beams of leptons and hadrons typically employ plane-wave states with definite momenta and energies. In contrast, vortex states represent cylindrical waves carrying a well-defined orbital angular momentum projection along the propagation direction. This projection can be arbitrarily large, endowing such particles with magnetic moments orders of magnitude greater than those of plane-wave states. Consequently, vortex particles could complement - or even replace - spin-polarized beams in high-energy collisions, enabling access to observables beyond the reach of the conventional states. Although relativistic vortex beams have yet to be realized, we investigate the radiative and non-radiative dynamics of angular momentum for vortex particles in accelerators. We compute the timescale for angular momentum loss via photon emission, finding it significantly longer than typical acceleration times. The non-radiative dynamics is governed by precession, with the orbital angular momentum precessing at a frequency markedly different from that of spin. Similar to spin tunes in circular accelerators, this can induce resonances that disrupt the beam's orbital momentum - occurring far more frequently for vortex beams than for spin-polarized ones. Thus, vortex particle acceleration can be more feasible in linacs, while Siberian snakes could serve as a tool for angular momentum manipulations.",

    "title": "Monochromation of pulsed electron beams with terahertz radiation at a planar mirror",
    "abstract": "Exquisite control of electron beam energy is required for many electron spectroscopy and imaging applications. For both continuous and pulsed beams, the beam energy spread is fundamentally limited by the electron source, and is typically a sizable fraction of an electron-volt. In this paper, we present a means to reduce electron beam energy spread after emission to the level of a few 10s of meV rms using femtosecond photoemission and an interaction with laser-derived single- to few-cycle terahertz (THz) radiation. We show analytically and in particle tracking simulations that this interaction can remove energy spread stored in both the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom. We analytically formulate the limit of energy spread that this technique can achieve, and map the non-ideal affects arising at high frequencies. The interaction is mediated by the beam's passage through a mirror which is reflective to terahertz radiation but allows transmission of the majority of the electron beam (e.g. a wire mesh). This method then only requires beam current losses of a few tens of percent, far smaller than what is achieved in prism and slit-based electron monochromators.",

    "abstract": "As Fusion Pilot Plants (FPPs) are increasingly viewed as within reach, many engineering challenges remain. Not many diagnostics are expected to be available in a reactor environment. Survivability, maintainability, and limited port space substantially restrict the number of FPP-relevant diagnostics. One remaining challenge is developing tools and devices to extract plasma state information necessary for controlling an FPP from a limited subset of diagnostics. This work is part of an overarching project to address this challenge. The specific diagnostic subset to be used in FPPs is still under debate. We take the approach of developing machine-learning-based tools for different significant plasma state parameters, using already known FPP-viable diagnostics. Previously we developed a plasma confinement mode classifier utilizing the Electron Cyclotron Emission (ECE) diagnostic. Here, we expand on this by developing a Profile Reflectometer (PR) based classifier with 97\\% test accuracy, and an ensemble model that combines the ECE and PR models into a single model, achieving 99\\% test accuracy.",

    "title": "Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear flows",
    "abstract": "In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that perturbations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfvénic, raising the possibility that shear-driven turbulence may be found even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a fast and highly efficient method for the measurement of $^{210}$Pb in metallic archaeological lead using the commercial low-background liquid scintillation counter Wallac Quantulus 1220 installed at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy). By combining an optimized chemical preparation with pulse-shape analysis (PSA), the technique achieves sensitivities at the level of a few $10^2$ mBq/kg within one week of measurement, using sample masses below 1 g. The method enables the simultaneous identification of the $β$ decays of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Bi and the $α$ decay of $^{210}$Po, allowing a direct verification of secular equilibrium within the decay chain. With extended acquisition times, detection limits below 100 mBq/kg are reached after approximately 40 days. This approach provides a rapid, accessible, and reliable tool for the radiopurity screening of lead, and is well suited for quality control and R&D activities in next-generation low-background and rare-event physics experiments. Moreover, the method has the potential to be extended to other materials relevant for low-background applications.",

    "abstract": "Double-sided strip high-purity germanium detectors with three-dimensional position reconstruction capability have been developed over three decades, with space-based applications in high-energy astrophysics and heliophysics. Position resolution in three dimensions is key to reconstruction of Compton scattering events, including for the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) satellite mission. Two-dimensional position reconstruction is enabled by segmentation of the two detector faces into orthogonal strip contacts, enabling a pixelized analysis. The depth of an interaction cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from the charge collection time difference between the two faces of the detector. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the depth calibration of a detector with the COSI satellite geometry read out using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed for the COSI mission. In this work, we map collection time difference to depth using the Julia-based simulation package SolidStateDetectors$.$jl and validate it with comparison to the timing distributions observed in data. We also use simulations and data to demonstrate the depth resolution on a per-pixel basis, with >90% of pixels having <0.9 mm (FWHM) resolution at 59.5 keV and <0.6 mm (FWHM) resolution at 122.1 keV.",

    "title": "Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current sheets in 2D MHD simulations?",
    "abstract": "We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest-resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets performed on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers of $10^3 \\le S \\le 5 \\times 10^5$ , reaching up to $65,536^2$ grid cells. We demonstrate a Sweet--Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \\sim 10^4$. For larger values of Lundquist number, between $2\\times 10^4\\le S \\le 2 \\times 10^5$, plasmoid formation sets in, leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity-dependent and therefore slow. In this range of $S$-values, the plasmoids do not undergo a merger cascade, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Only for $S > 2 \\times 10^5$, we observe the nonlinear development of the tearing-mode instability, with plasmoid coalescence and a saturation of the reconnection rate at $V_\\text{rec} / V_A \\sim 0.01$. At such high $S$, however, the corresponding Reynolds number is large, reaching $\\text{Re} > 2000$ even on scales comparable to the current-sheet thickness. We therefore conclude that, in astrophysical systems, it is essential to account for the dominant influence of turbulence and three-dimensional effects in the reconnection process.",

    "title": "Fast prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition",
    "abstract": "Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.",

    "title": "Distributed Inter-Strand Coupling Current Model for Finite Element Simulations of Rutherford Cables",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the Distributed Inter-Strand Coupling Current (DISCC) model. It is a finite element (FE) model based on a homogenization approach enabling efficient and accurate simulation of the transient magnetic response of superconducting Rutherford cables without explicitly representing individual strands. The DISCC model reproduces the inter-strand coupling current dynamics via a novel mixed FE formulation, and can be combined with the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) and Flux (ROHF) models in order to reproduce the effects of internal strand dynamics: hysteresis, eddy, and inter-filament coupling currents, as well as ohmic effects. The DISCC model offers a massive reduction of the computational time compared to fully detailed FE models and still accounts for all types of loss and magnetization contributions. As a result, Rutherford cables homogenized with the DISCC model can be directly included in FE models of magnet cross-sections for efficient electro-magneto-thermal simulations of their transient response. We present two possible FE formulations for the implementation of the DISCC model, a first one based on the h-phi-formulation, and a second one based on the h-phi-a-formulation, which is well suited for an efficient treatment of the ferromagnetic regions in magnet cross-sections.",

    "abstract": "We derive statistical distributions for the degrees of freedom in wave packet molecular dynamics models. Specifically, a theory is developed for the width distributions of Gaussian wavepackets in both isotropic and anisotropic formulations. The resulting distribution functions show good agreement with molecular dynamics data under warm dense matter conditions, providing practical guidance for constraining the confining potential, an empirical parameter in the model. We also discuss how these distributions influence the resulting effective Coulomb interactions.",

    "title": "Heat load measurements for the PIP-II pHB650 cryomodule",
    "abstract": "Phase-3 testing of the pHB650 cryomodule at the PIP-II Injector Test Facility was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of heat load mitigations performed after earlier phases of testing and to continue pinpointing any sources of unexpectedly high heat loads.. The programme measured HTTS, LTTS, and 2 K isothermal/non-isothermal loads under \"standard\", \"linac\", and \"simulated dynamic\" operating modes, recording data both inside the cryomodule and across the bayonet can circuits. Thermal-acoustic oscillations were eliminated by replacing the original G10 cooldown-valve stem with a stainless-steel stem fitted with wipers. A newly developed Python script automated acquisition of ACNET data, performed real-time heat-load calculations, and generated plots and tables that were posted to the electronic logbook within minutes, vastly reducing manual effort and accelerating feedback between SRF and cryogenics teams. Analysis showed that JT heat-exchanger effectiveness and temperature stratification in the two-phase and relief piping strongly influence the observed loads and helped isolate sources of excess heat. The campaign demonstrates that rigorous pre-test planning, real-time diagnostics, and automated reporting can improve both accuracy and efficiency, providing a template for future PIP-II cryomodule tests and for implementing targeted heat-load mitigations.",

    "title": "Design and Performance of a 96-channel Resistive PICOSEC Micromegas Detector for ENUBET",
    "abstract": "The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a fast gaseous detector that achieves picosecond-level timing by coupling a Cherenkov radiator, typically an MgF2 crystal, to a Micromegas-based photodetector with a photocathode. This configuration allows the fast photoelectron-induced signal to suppress the intrinsic time jitter of gaseous detectors, enabling sub-20 ps timing precision while preserving the robustness and scalability of micro-pattern gaseous detector technologies. The 96-pad PICOSEC-MM detector is a large-area demonstrator optimized for precision timing in high-energy physics, building on research and development insights from earlier 7-pad resistive prototypes to validate scalability, uniformity, and robustness for the ENUBET project. It employs a 2.5 nm diamond-like carbon photocathode and a Micromegas board with a surface resistivity of 10 megaohms per square, and was characterized using 150 GeV/c muons at the CERN SPS beamline, with one-third of the active area instrumented per run. A dedicated alignment procedure for multi-pad PICOSEC-MM systems was used to reconstruct pad centers and merge measurements across regions, yielding a timing resolution of 43 ps and uniform signal arrival time distributions over the tested area. Mechanical flatness was identified as a key factor, with planarity tolerances within 10 micrometers required to maintain good timing resolution, and the successful operation of the 96-pad demonstrator confirms the scalability of the PICOSEC-MM concept toward robust, high-granularity, picosecond-level gaseous timing detectors for monitored neutrino beam experiments such as ENUBET.",

    "title": "Performance and radiation damage mitigation strategy for silicon photomultipliers on LEO space missions",
    "abstract": "Space missions require lightweight, low-power consuming, radiation-tolerant components. Silicon photomultipliers are increasingly used for detecting near-UV, optical, and infrared light in space due to their compact design, low cost, low power consumption, robustness, and high photo-detection efficiency, which makes them sensitive to single photons. Although SiPMs outperform traditional photomultiplier tubes in many areas, concerns about their radiation tolerance and noise remain. In this study, we estimate the radiation effects on a satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550~km during the declining phase of solar cycle 25 (2026-2029). We evaluated silicon photomultipliers produced by the Foundation Bruno Kessler (FBK) using front-side illuminated technology with metal trenches (NUV-HD-MT), assessing their response to a 50~MeV proton beam and exposure to a $β$-radioactive source (strontium-90). Simulations with SPENVIS and Geant4 were used to validate the experimental results. Based on our findings, we propose a photosensor annealing strategy for space-based instruments.",

    "abstract": "We report on R&D study to improve the photon detection efficiency of water Cherenkov detectors by doping ultra-pure water with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a wavelength shifting additive. Cherenkov light yields from cosmic-ray muons were measured for various 4-MU concentrations and compared with those from pure water. At a concentration of 1 ppm, the detected light yield increased by approximately a factor of three. This enhancement can be attributed to wavelength shifting and improved photon collection efficiency. No noticeable degradation in optical transparency was observed across the tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 ppm with different concentration of ethanol. These results suggest that 4-MU is a promising additive for improving the performance of water Cherenkov detectors.",

    "title": "Multigrid Poisson Solver for Complex Geometries Using Finite Difference Method",
    "abstract": "We present an efficient numerical method, inspired by transformation optics, for solving the Poisson equation in complex and arbitrarily shaped geometries. The approach operates by mapping the physical domain to a uniform computational domain through coordinate transformations, which can be applied either to the entire domain or selectively to specific boundaries inside the domain. This flexibility allows both homogeneous (Laplace equation) and inhomogeneous (Poisson equation) problems to be solved efficiently using iterative or fast direct solvers, with only the material parameters and source terms modified according to the transformation. The method is formulated within a finite difference framework, where the modified material properties are computed from the coordinate transformation equations, either analytically or numerically. This enables accurate treatment of arbitrary geometric shapes while retaining the simplicity of a uniform grid solver. Numerical experiments confirm that the method achieves second-order accuracy , and offers a straightforward pathway to integrate fast solvers such as multigrid methods on the uniform computational grid.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel single-photon detector based on a vacuum tube incorporating a photocathode, a microchannel plate (MCP), and a Timepix4 CMOS ASIC functioning as a pixelated anode. Designed to handle photon rates up to 1 billion per second across a 7 cm$^2$ active area, the detector achieves outstanding spatial and temporal resolutions of 5-10 $μ$m and below 50 ps r.m.s., respectively.   The Timepix4 ASIC comprises approximately 230,000 pixels, each integrating analog and digital front-end electronics. This enables data-driven acquisition and supports data transmission rates up to 160 Gb/s. External FPGA-based electronics manage both configuration and readout.   In order to test the timing performance of the Timepix4 ASIC we performed preliminary characterization of an assembly bonded to a 100 $μ$m thick n-on-p silicon sensor using a pulsed infrared laser, which demonstrated a per-pixel timing resolution of 110 ps, with cluster-based averaging methods improving to below 50 ps.   Six prototype detectors incorporating different MCP stack configurations and end-spoiling depths were produced by Hamamatsu Photonics. We report on their characterization, including dark count rates, gain, and spatial and timing resolutions, assessed both in laboratory conditions and during a test-beam campaign at CERN's SPS facility.",

    "title": "Proton Energy Dependence of Radiation Induced Low Gain Avalanche Detector Degradation",
    "abstract": "Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are key components for precise timing measurements in high-energy physics experiments, including the High Luminosity upgrades of the current LHC detectors. Their performance is, however, limited by radiation induced degradation of the gain layer, primarily driven by acceptor removal. This study presents a systematic comparison of how the degradation evolves with different incident proton energies, using LGADs from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and The Institute of Microelectronics of Barcelona (IMB-CNM) irradiated with 18 MeV, 24 MeV, 400 MeV and 23 GeV protons and fluences up to 2.5x10^15 p/cm2. Electrical characterization is used to extract the acceptor removal coefficients for different proton energies, whereas IR TCT measurements offer complementary insight into the gain evolution in LGADs after irradiation. Across all devices, lower energy protons induce stronger gain layer degradation, confirming expectations. However, 400 MeV protons consistently appear less damaging than both lower and higher energy protons, an unexpected deviation from a monotonic energy trend. Conversion of proton fluences to 1 MeV neutron-equivalent fluences reduces but does not eliminate these differences, indicating that the standard Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) scaling does not fully account for the underlying defect formation mechanisms at different energies and requires revision when considering irradiation fields that contain a broader spectrum of particle types and energies.",

    "abstract": "Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) are widely used in searches for rare dark matter and neutrino interactions, in part because of their excellent position reconstruction capability in 3D. Despite their millimeter-scale resolution along the charge drift axis, xenon TPCs face challenges in resolving single-site (SS) and multi-site (MS) interactions in the transverse plane. In this paper, we build a generic TPC model with an idealized signal readout, and use Fisher Information (FI) to predict its theoretical capability of differentiating SS and MS events using the electroluminescence signal. We also demonstrate via simulation that, when only statistical photon noise is present, the theoretical limits can be approached with conventional reconstruction algorithms like maximum likelihood estimation, and with a convolutional neural network classifier. The implications of this study on future TPC experiments will be discussed.",
