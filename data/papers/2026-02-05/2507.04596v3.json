  "title": "On Topology of Perturbed Vortices",
  "abstract": "This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices in full three dimensional context.",
