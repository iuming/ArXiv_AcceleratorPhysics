  "title": "Predicting the single-site and multi-site event discrimination power of dual-phase time projection chambers",
  "abstract": "Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) are widely used in searches for rare dark matter and neutrino interactions, in part because of their excellent position reconstruction capability in 3D. Despite their millimeter-scale resolution along the charge drift axis, xenon TPCs face challenges in resolving single-site (SS) and multi-site (MS) interactions in the transverse plane. In this paper, we build a generic TPC model with an idealized signal readout, and use Fisher Information (FI) to predict its theoretical capability of differentiating SS and MS events using the electroluminescence signal. We also demonstrate via simulation that, when only statistical photon noise is present, the theoretical limits can be approached with conventional reconstruction algorithms like maximum likelihood estimation, and with a convolutional neural network classifier. The implications of this study on future TPC experiments will be discussed.",
