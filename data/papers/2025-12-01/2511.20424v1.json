  "title": "Planar Josephson junctions for sensors and electronics:Different geometry, new functionality",
  "abstract": "Josephson junctions are key elements in superconducting electronics. The most common type is the overlap (sandwich-type) junction, formed by vertically stacking two superconducting layers. In contrast, planar junctions are fabricated without overlap, at the edge of two superconducting films within a single plane. This geometric distinction has a significant impact on their physical properties. The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes. I will also discuss the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the evolving field of superconducting electronics.",
