  "title": "Design and simulation of the High-Energy Proton Beam Telescope",
  "abstract": "A high-resolution beam telescope is essential for the precise characterization of silicon pixel sensors. As part of the CSNS-II upgrade project, a High-Energy Proton Beam Telescope (HEPTel) based on monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) has been designed for the forthcoming High-Energy Proton Experimental Station (HPES), which will provide 0.8 to 1.6 GeV single-particle proton beams. HEPTel consists of six ultra-thin telescope modules, with a material budget per module of about 0.061% X0. Simulated with a 1.6 GeV proton beam, the telescope is expected to achieve a resolution of about 1.83 micrometers. Additionally, a dedicated readout electronics system and a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system have been designed for HEPTel, based on which a preliminary test system was established for beam tests. The beam test results with 1.3 GeV electrons demonstrated a single-module resolution of about 5.77 micrometers, an overall telescope resolution of about 2.70 micrometers, and a detection efficiency above 99.5%. These results validate the HEPTel design and confirm its capability for forthcoming proton-beam experiments at HPES.",
