  "title": "Exact moment models for conservation laws in phase space",
  "abstract": "Moment equations offer a compelling alternative to the kinetic description of plasmas, gases, and liquids. Their simulation requires fewer degrees of freedom than phase space models, yet it can still incorporate kinetic effects to a certain extent. To derive moment equations, we use a parameterization of the distribution function using centered moments, as proposed by Burby. This yields moment equations for which the parameterized distribution function exactly solves the hyperbolic conservation law. Similarly, a particle model is derived based on a parametrization of the distribution function using phase space moments. Finally, we present the application of the method to the non-relativistic and relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell equations.",
