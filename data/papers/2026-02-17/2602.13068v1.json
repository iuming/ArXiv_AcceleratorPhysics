  "title": "Structure preservation using discrete gradients in the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system",
  "abstract": "We present a novel structure-preserving framework for solving the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system of equations using a particle in cell (PIC) discretization combined with discrete gradient time integrators. The Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system is an accurate model for studying hot plasma dynamics at a kinetic scale where small-angle Coulomb collisions dominate. Our scheme guarantees conservation of mass, momentum and energy as well as preservation of the monotonicity of entropy production in both the time-continuous and discrete systems. We employ the conservative integrator for both the Hamiltonian Vlasov-Poisson equations and the dissipative Landau equation using the PETSc library (www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc) to showcase structure-preserving properties.",
