  "title": "A Transformer-based Model for Rapid Microstructure Inference from Four-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Data",
  "abstract": "Properties of crystalline materials are closely linked to microstructure arising from the spatial arrangement, orientation, and phase of nanocrystals. Rapid characterization of crystalline microstructure can accelerate the identification of these links and the development of materials with desired properties. Here, we combine a machine learning framework with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to enable fast inference of crystalline microstructure over large fields of view. The framework employs a transformer-based architecture to predict crystallographic orientations and phases from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, yielding spatially resolved maps of microstructural features at the nanoscale. With this framework, crystallographic orientations are inferred up to two orders of magnitude faster than widely used correlative template-matching approaches. This capability enables high-throughput characterization of complex crystalline materials and facilitates the establishment of structure-property relationships central to materials design and optimization.",
