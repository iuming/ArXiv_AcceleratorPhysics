  "title": "Collisionless relaxation as the origin of the anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature momentum distributions observed in space plasmas",
  "abstract": "Anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature distributed particle momenta are commonly observed in collisionless space plasmas, such as the solar wind. Using Liouville's theorem, we argue that anisotropic compression or expansion of the plasma, followed by a relaxation of the resulting anisotropic stress must lead to non-equilibrium states that are either anisotropic, non-thermal distribution functions, different electron and ion temperatures, or a combination of these effects. We present arguments showing that a plasma in thermal equilibrium undergoing anisotropic compression or expansion cannot return to thermal equilibrium in the absence of particle collisions. Since most astrophysical plasmas are practically collisionless and experience significant anisotropic compression or expansion, we expect anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature particle distributions to be ubiquitous, in agreement with solar wind measurements.",
