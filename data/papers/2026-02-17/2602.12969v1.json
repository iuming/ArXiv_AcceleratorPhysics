  "title": "Role of the radial electric field in the confinement of energetic ions in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator",
  "abstract": "Good fast-ion confinement is an essential requirement for a fusion reactor. The magnetic configuration of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator is partially optimized in this regard in a reactor-relevant scenario: it is expected to show improved fast-ion confinement when $β$ is high and the effect of the radial electric field is negligible. The experimental validation of this optimization is difficult since, with the available power, achieving high $β$ under appropriate conditions for the validation is challenging and the effect of the radial electric field is inevitable. In this work, the confinement of fast ions in W7-X has been studied numerically for a variety of scenarios via the ASCOT5 code. The effect of the radial electric field on fast-ion losses is confirmed to be equivalent to the one produced by $β$, and this is characterized by means of scans on both parameters. Through a preliminary study with experimentally-based profiles, a viable scenario is identified that takes advantage of this effect for the experimental validation of the optimization strategy of W7-X.",
