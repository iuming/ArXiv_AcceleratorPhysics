  "title": "Long-Pulse Fast Ignition in MagLIF",
  "abstract": "The fast ignition paradigm for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) allows for extremely high gains but requires fuel to be heated very quickly to outpace hotspot disassembly and energy losses. This demands lasers with high power and intensity, posing engineering challenges that have called into question the fundamental practicality of fast ignition. Magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF) circumvents these problems through its large-aspect-ratio cylindrical geometry and strong axial magnetic fields that allow for ignition at lower areal densities. Furthermore, MagLIF's large aspect ratio and higher yields relax other constraints on energy deposition and repetition rate while its axial magnetic fields can be used to collimate ignitor electrons and thereby increase allowed standoff distance and save on ignitor energy. This tremendous overall relaxation of the engineering constraints that have historically limited the practicality of fast ignition suggests that the paradigm may be considerably more viable in a MagLIF context.",
