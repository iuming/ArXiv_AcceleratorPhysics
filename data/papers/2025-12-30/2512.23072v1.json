  "title": "Thermodynamically Consistent Vibrational-Electron Heating: Generalized Model for Multi-Quantum Transitions",
  "abstract": "Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\\rm e}$) is critical for non-equilibrium plasma applications ranging from hypersonic flight to plasma-assisted combustion. We recently proposed a thermodynamically consistent model for vibrational-electron heating [Phys. Fluids 37, 096141 (2025)] that enforces the convergence of $T_{\\rm e}$ to the vibrational temperature ($T_{\\rm v}$) at equilibrium. However, the original derivation was restricted to single-quantum transitions, limiting its validity to low-temperature regimes ($T_{\\rm e} \\lesssim 1.5$ eV). In this Letter, we generalize the model to include multi-quantum overtone transitions, extending its applicability to high-energy regimes. We demonstrate that previous models neglecting hot-band transitions incur a systematic heating error of $\\exp(-θ_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm v})$, where $θ_{\\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature. This error exceeds 40\\% when $T_{\\rm v}$ is greater than $θ_{\\rm v}$, effectively preventing thermal relaxation. To correct this, we derive a formulation where the total heating rate is a summation of channel-specific cooling rates $Q_{\\rm e-v}^{(m)}$, each associated with a quantum jump $m$, scaled by a thermodynamic factor $\\exp(mθ_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm e}-mθ_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm v})$. This generalized model preserves thermodynamic consistency by ensuring zero net energy transfer at equilibrium.",
