  "title": "Plastic inorganic Sn2BiS2I3 semiconductor enabled deformable and flexible electronic tongue for heavy metal detection",
  "abstract": "Deformable and flexible electronics have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties; however, their current applications are primarily limited to the thermoelectric domain. Expanding the range of these electronics and their application scope represents a pivotal trend in their development. In this work, a plastic inorganic semiconductor material, Sn2BiS2I3, with a band gap of 1.2 eV was synthesized and fabricated into a three-electrode flexible and portable electronic tongue capable of detecting heavy metal elements. The electronic tongue device exhibits exceptional linearity and demonstrates resistance against interference from impurity ions. The linear regression equation is expressed as Y=0.24+19.06X, yielding a linear coefficient of approximately 0.96, and the detectable limit stands at around 1.1 ppb, surpassing the 2.0 ppb limit of the ICP-AES instrument. Furthermore, mechanical testing reveals the favorable plasticity of Sn2BiS2I3, as evidenced by the absence of cracks during nanoindentation. The indentation hardness of Sn2BiS2I3 is approximately 1.67 GPa, slightly exceeding the hardness of Cu, which is 1.25 GPa. This study expands the repertoire of deformable and flexible electronics, offering a new and exceptional choice for biomimetic tongue sensor materials.",
