  "title": "Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection",
  "abstract": "When electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, the field lines of $\\vec{B}$ reconnect, but the lines of a related field $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}}$ do not. $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}} \\equiv \\vec{B} + \\vec{\\nabla}\\times \\left( (c/ω_{pe})^2μ_0\\vec{j} \\right)$ with $ω_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\\vec{j}$ the current density. Although a full four-dimensional relativistic calculation of $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}}$ has been made, studies of $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}}$ have been focused on systems that depend on only two spatial coordinates. Three results are given: (1) A relatively simple demonstration in three dimensional space that the lines of $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}}$ do not reconnect when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect. (2) The guiding center motion of charged particles is modified by a term that is proportional to $(c/ω_{pe})^2$, which is smaller than the drifts proportional to the gyroradius unless the current density is extremely large. (3) In three dimensional space, the evolution velocity of $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}}$ is characteristically chaotic, which means neighboring streamlines separate exponentially on a timescale $τ_u$. $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}}$ undergoes large scale reconnection on a timescale that is only an order of magnitude or two longer than $τ_u$ unless all diffusive non-ideal effects, such as resistivity, are absolutely zero.",
