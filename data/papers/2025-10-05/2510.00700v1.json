  "title": "Full-Field Brillouin Microscopy with a Scanning Fabry-Perot   Interferometer",
  "abstract": "Brillouin microscopy is an emerging optical technique for probing mechanical properties with submicron resolution, offering fully non-contact, label-free operation. Despite its unique capabilities, broader adoption has been limited by slow acquisition speeds, particularly in systems based on scanning Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs). Based on prior implementations, FPIs have typically been considered too slow for practical imaging, particularly when both spatial and spectral precision are required. Here, we demonstrate that a standard multi-pass tandem FPI can be repurposed for full-field Brillouin imaging when operated in a spectral filtering mode. Combined with light-sheet illumination for uniform, low-dose excitation, this configuration enables rapid, spatially resolved acquisition of Brillouin spectra. By restricting scanning to a narrow frequency range around the Brillouin peak, we acquired a full 2D image within one minute, achieving millisecond-scale single pixel dwell times and micrometer-scale spatial resolution. The system uniquely supports Brillouin emission imaging at selected frequency shifts, a capability not available with other spontaneous Brillouin implementations. Results from synthetic and biological specimens demonstrate how existing FPI-based setups can be extended to full-field imaging and outline a pathway toward future dedicated FPI instruments optimized for high-speed, high-contrast Brillouin microscopy.",
