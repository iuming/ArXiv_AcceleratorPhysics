  "title": "Relativistic Jets and Winds in Radio-Identified Supermassive Black Hole   Binary Candidates",
  "abstract": "Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.",
