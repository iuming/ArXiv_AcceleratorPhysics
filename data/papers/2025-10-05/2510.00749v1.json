  "title": "Effects of Neutron Irradiation on LGADs with Broad Multiplication Layer   and varied Carbon-Enriched Doses: A Study on Timing Performance and Gain   Deterioration",
  "abstract": "In this radiation tolerance study, Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) with a carbon-enriched broad and shallow multiplication layer were examined in comparison to identical non-carbonated LGADs. Manufactured at IMB-CNM, the sensors underwent neutron irradiation at the TRIGRA reactor in Ljubljana, reaching a fluence of $2.5 \\times 10^{15}n_{eq}cm^{-2}$. The results revealed a smaller deactivation of Boron and improved resistance to radiation in carbonated LGADs. The study demonstrated the potential benefits of carbon enrichment in mitigating radiation damage effects, particularly the acceptor removal mechanism, reducing the acceptor removal constant by more than a factor of two. Additionally, time resolution and collected charge degradation due to irradiation were observed, with carbonated samples exhibiting better radiation tolerance. A noise analysis focused on baseline noise and thermally generated pulses showed the presence of spurious thermal-generated pulses attributed to a excessive small distance between the gain layer end and the p-stop implant at the periphery of the pad for the characterized LGAD design; however, the operation performance of the devices was unaffected.",
