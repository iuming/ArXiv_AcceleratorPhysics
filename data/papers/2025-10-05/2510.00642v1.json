  "title": "Fabrication and Characterization of X-ray TES Detectors Based on Annular   AlMn Alloy Films",
  "abstract": "AlMn alloy flms are widely fabricated into superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs) for the detection of cosmic microwave background radiation. However, the application in X-ray or gamma-ray detection based on AlMn TES is rarely reported. In this study, X-ray TES detectors based on unique annular AlMn flms are devel-oped. The fabrication processes of TES detectors are introduced in detail. The char-acteristics of three TES samples are evaluated in a dilution refrigerator. The results demonstrate that the I-V characteristics of the three annular TES detectors are highly consistent. The TES detector with the smallest absorber achieved the best energy resolution of 11.0 eV @ 5.9 keV, which is inferior to the theoretical value. The dis-crepancy is mainly attributed to the larger readout electronics noise than expected.",
