  "title": "The Application of VMM3A Readout for Multi-Grid Neutron Detectors",
  "abstract": "The T-REX neutron spectrometer at the European Spallation Source will use Multi-Grid Technology, which is a voxelised proportional counter relying on\\mathrm{^{10}B_{4}C} coatings to detect the scattered neutrons. Measurements of the position dependence of pulse-height and relative detection efficiency of a Multi-Grid prototype of the T-REX spectrometer are presented for two different schemes of signal-processing electronics based on the VMM3A ASIC and CREMAT technology. These measurements, intended to test the suitability of VMM3A for readout of the T-REX Multi-Grid, are compared with Monte Carlo simulations based on the Garfield++ and Geant4 tool kits.",
