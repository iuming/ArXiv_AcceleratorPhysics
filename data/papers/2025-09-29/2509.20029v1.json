  "title": "Development of a time calibration system for the KLM upgrade in the   Belle II experiment",
  "abstract": "To meet the stringent time calibration requirements for the Belle II experiment upgrade, particularly for its large-size KL and Muon Detector comprising tens of thousands of scintillator channels with time resolutions better than 100 ps, we developed a compact and high-speed time calibration system. The system utilizes a laser diode as its light source, integrated with a fast pulse laser drive circuit that employs high-speed switching GaN FETs and gate drivers. A prototype was constructed and rigorously evaluated using scintillators, achieving timing resolutions of about 13 ps for a single calibration channel. Furthermore, internal deviations among calibration channels were analyzed, with most measurements remaining within 250 ps. These results highlight the system's precision, scalability, and suitability for large-scale particle physics experiments.",
