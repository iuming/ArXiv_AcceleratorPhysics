  "title": "Exploring the Fundamental Properties of Neutrino from Oscillation   Experiments",
  "abstract": "As physicists pursue precision neutrino measurements, complementary experiments covering varied oscillation landscapes have become essential for resolving current tensions in global fits. This thesis presents projected sensitivities and forecasted performance of two next-generation long-baseline experiments: DUNE and T2HK, through detailed simulations addressing fundamental questions including neutrino mass ordering, leptonic CP violation, and the octant of $\\theta_{23}$. We demonstrate through simulated analyses that while each experiment alone faces inherent degeneracies, their complementary features enable breakthrough projected sensitivities in both standard oscillation parameter measurements and forecasted searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The combined simulation results reveal that DUNE-T2HK synergy will be crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of neutrino properties in the coming decade.",
