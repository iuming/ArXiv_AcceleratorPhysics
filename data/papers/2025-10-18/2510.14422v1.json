  "title": "Nanodiamond photocathodes for MPGD-based single photon detectors",
  "abstract": "This study investigates the suitability of Hydrogenated NanoDiamond (HND) materials as an alternative for CsI in MPGD-based photon detectors. The research focuses on characterizing HND photocathodes coupled with THGEM + Micromegas-based detectors. The HND grains were prepared via hydrogenation and stored in water for more than two years. They were then coated on PCB discs or THGEMs using a pulsed spray technique. The resulting quantum efficiency (QE) values (~4% at 122 nm) were found to be within a factor of 10 of the best freshly hydrogenated samples reported in the literature ( ~40% at 120 nm). The robustness of reflective HND photocathodes against ion bombardment was measured to be about 10 times larger than the corresponding CsI one after the same charge accumulation. Furthermore, THGEM characterization indicates minimal alteration in response after HND coatings. These results suggest that HND holds potential as a more robust photocathode for gaseous detectors, offering improved performance in single-photon detection applications.",
