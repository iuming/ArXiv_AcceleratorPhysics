  "title": "Structure of self-generated magnetic fields in laser-solid interaction   from proton tomography",
  "abstract": "Strong magnetic fields are naturally self-generated in high-power, laser-solid interactions through the Biermann-battery mechanism. This work experimentally characterizes the 3D location and strength of these fields, rather than path-integrated quantities, through multi-view proton radiography and tomographic inversion on the OMEGA laser. We infer magnetic fields that extend several millimeters off the target surface into the hot, rarefied corona and are sufficient to strongly magnetize the plasma ($\\Omega_{e}\\tau_e \\gg 1$). The data is used to validate MHD simulations incorporating recent improvements in magnetic transport modeling; we achieve reasonable agreement only with models with re-localization of transport by magnetic fields. This work provides a key demonstration of tomographic inversion in proton radiography, offering a valuable tool for investigating magnetic fields in laser-produced plasmas.",
