  "title": "Three-dimensional unmagnetized Mach probe analysis and initial flow   measurements in reversed-field pinch experiments",
  "abstract": "A novel matrix method of analyzing ion saturation current data from a general three-dimensional (3D) array of unmagnetized Mach probe tips is developed and used with data sets from two 3D Mach probes to make initial measurements of local plasma flow velocity in reversed-field pinch (RFP) experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST). The two 3D Mach probes are composed of regular polyhedral arrays of six and four tips, respectively, with the six-tip array composed of three orthogonal pairs of mutually opposite tips at the vertices of a regular octahedron and the four-tip array composed of non-opposite tips at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, the analysis of which is specifically facilitated by the matrix method. Velocity measurement uncertainties for the Mach probes are derived based on uncertainties in probe machining and ion saturation current measurements, and typical relative uncertainties for the probes are estimated to be of order several percent, likely smaller than systematic uncertainties related to the Mach probe calibration constant and experimental uncertainties related to plasma and probe conditioning. Initial results for the octahedral probe show flow speeds of roughly the expected magnitudes based on previous MST measurements but with somes differences in flow direction, while those for the tetrahedron probe show similar flow directions to some previous measurements but also some larger than expected speeds. We consider possible causes for the unexpected results of these initial tests, with a focus on probe conditioning and fast electron issues.",
