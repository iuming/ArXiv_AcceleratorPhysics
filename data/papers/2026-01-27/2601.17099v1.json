  "title": "Detecting the full photoemission cone from laser-based ARPES experiments by leveraging deflector technology",
  "abstract": "Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct access to the electronic band structure of solid and molecular systems. The momentum range accessible by this technique depends directly on the photon energy used, and low-photon-energy sources are insufficient to photoemit electrons over the full Brillouin zone of most quantum materials. In addition, while electrons are emitted over a 2$π$ solid angle, conventional hemispherical analyzers only collect a small subset of those electrons. A previous work [RSI 92, 123907 (2021)] demonstrated that electrons emitted over a larger field-of-view can be acquired in one fixed configuration by accelerating them towards the analyzer with a bias voltage. Here, we extend this work by leveraging the deflector technology of novel ARPES hemispherical analyzers. We demonstrate the ability to detect all $2π$ photoemitted electrons in a fixed configuration for various materials such as gold, cuprates and transition-metal dichalcogenides. This approach is especially advantageous for time-resolved ARPES, as electron dynamics over a large momentum range can be accessed with identical measurement conditions.",
