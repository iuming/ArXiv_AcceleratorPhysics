  "title": "Millimeter-Wave Transmission-Line Reflectionless Filters",
  "abstract": "We report on the development of transmission-line reflectionless filters operating with passbands at 100 GHz and 230 GHz, and stopband absorption up to 500 GHz, the highest operating frequencies yet recorded for such filters. The designs are based on a previously reported mathematical solution to the reflectionless condition, now successfully implemented for the first time, using an advanced thin-film fabrication process on Alumina substrates. Sub-millimeter wave wafer probe measurements show good agreement with theory.",
