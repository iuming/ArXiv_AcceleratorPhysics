  "title": "Investigation of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering Driven by Broadband Lasers in High-Z Plasmas",
  "abstract": "The evolution of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) driven by broadband lasers in high-Z plasmas is investigated using one-dimensional collisional particle-in-cell simulations. The temporal incoherence of broadband lasers modulates the pump intensity, generating stochastic intensity pulses that intermittently drive SBS. The shortened coherence time weakens the three-wave coupling and continuously reduces the temporal growth rate, while the saturated reflectivity remains nearly unchanged until the bandwidth exceeds a critical threshold. Simulations with varying laser intensities and bandwidths reveal a consistent scaling behavior, indicating that effective suppression occurs only when the laser bandwidth exceeds the temporal growth rate of SBS by several tens of times. Comparative simulations in Au and AuB plasmas exhibit similar suppression trends, with AuB showing reduced SBS growth rate and reflectivity, and the onset of suppression occurring at a lower bandwidth. These findings elucidate the coupled dependence of SBS mitigation on bandwidth and laser intensity in high-Z plasmas, offering useful guidance for optimizing broadband laser designs in inertial confinement fusion.",
