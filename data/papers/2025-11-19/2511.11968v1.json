  "title": "An Adjoint Formulation of Energetic Particle Confinement",
  "abstract": "An adjoint formulation of energetic particle confinement in axisymmetric geometry is derived and evaluated using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The PINN estimates the escape time of energetic ions by solving an inhomogeneous adjoint of the drift kinetic equation with a Lorentz collision operator, yielding predictions of the escape time of fast ions in tokamak geometry due to direct ion orbit loss and collisional transport. This is the first time a PINN has been used to solve the drift kinetic equation in tokamak geometry, a challenging problem due to the large time scale separation present between the rapid transit time of energetic ions, and their slow collision time scale. It is shown that a careful and intentional design of a PINN is able to learn the escape time for the majority of the geometry considered, suggesting a path toward constructing a rapid surrogate for use in a broader optimization framework.",
