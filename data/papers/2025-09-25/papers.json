    "title": "Rapid muon tomography for border security",
    "abstract": "Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.",

    "title": "Conceptual design of a Doppler Backscattering diagnostic for the EXL-50U   spherical tokamak",
    "abstract": "The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $<$ $\\rho$ $<$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$<$ $k_{\\perp}$ $<$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\\rho$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\\sim35^{\\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).",

    "title": "On the Overestimation of Efficiency in Relativistic Electron Scattering",
    "abstract": "Recent reviews in ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) have claimed that relativistic electrons exhibit enhanced elastic scattering efficiency, frequently quantified as a \\gamma^2 increase in the differential cross section. These claims, however, originate from angular-domain analyses that overlook the compression of scattering angles \\theta with increasing electron energy, leading to an apparent, but artificial, enhancement. In this work, we recast the problem in momentum-transfer space q, where scattering is accurately accounted for. This transformation eliminates the angular compression artefact and reveals that high-energy scaling follows a simple \\beta^{-2} dependence, with no intrinsic relativistic gain. We demonstrate this by directly integrating relativistic differential elastic-scattering cross sections from ELSEPA and by applying a straightforward transformation of the well-known Mott-Massey formalism into q-space. The results are general, with calculations performed for elements from carbon to gold and for energies between 50 keV and 5000 keV. They reproduce the long-established trend in total elastic scattering cross sections, in which scattering strength decreases with increasing electron kinetic energy. Practically, at energies above roughly 50 keV, scattering is already dominated by the forward direction, and most of the scattered intensity falls within the acceptance range of typical UED detectors. These findings correct a widespread misconception in the UED literature and provide a more accurate and intuitive framework for interpreting and optimizing high-energy electron scattering experiments.",

    "title": "A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in   EMC3",
    "abstract": "One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \\varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.",

    "abstract": "Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\\gamma} \\gtrsim 3\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.",

The timing structure of CEPC has been restudied with the collaboration of the accelerator team and the detector team. After discussions between two sides, the CEPC bunch structure is set such that the spacings between adjacent bunches in any CEPC operation mode are integer numbers of 23.08 ns. The master CEPC clock will be provided by the accelerator to the detector systems with a frequency of 43.33 MHz, synchronous to the beam. The CEPC detector system relies on the clock to sample physics signal at the right time. It was found that if the circumference of CEPC is slightly changed to 99955.418 m, not only is the orbit length closer to 100 km, but also the detector would benefit more for the first 10-year operation.",

    "abstract": "Limited radiation hardness is the primary drawback to implementing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) in high-luminosity environments, such as the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment. Hadron irradiation generates defects in the silicon lattice of SiPMs, increasing dark current, dark count rate (DCR), crosstalk, and afterpulsing, while degrading gain and photon resolution. The expected radiation dose in the photon camera of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the CBM experiment ranges from $8\\times 10^9$ to $5\\times 10^{10}$ n$_{\\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$ after two-months of operation at maximum beam energy and intensity. In this work, we evaluated the radiation hardness of three different SiPMs: AFBR-S4N66P024M, S14160-6050HS, and MICROFC-60035. The samples were exposed to neutron irradiation with doses ranging from $3\\times 10^8$ to $1\\times 10^{11}$ n$_{\\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$. The neutron radiation damage was found to increase the SiPM dark current up to $10^3$ times, DCR up to $10^2$ times, and afterpulsing up to $10\\%$ while decreasing their gain and photon resolution. We performed electrical annealing (250 $^{\\circ}$C/30 min) on the samples to recover the photon resolution and decrease the DCR and dark current.",

We report the first observation of intermittent viscoelastic turbulence in such plasmas using large-scale three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations. In driven dissipative SCP, we observe scale-dependent flow dynamics arising from the interplay between potential (elastic) and viscous dissipation at the particle level. Unlike conventional turbulence, governed by inertia and viscosity, SCP exhibits distinct energy transfer processes due to its intrinsic viscoelasticity. Both kinetic and elastic energy spectra show power-law scaling $E(k), \\Phi(k) \\propto k^{-3.5}$. In real space, velocity structure functions display nontrivial scaling, and the probability distribution functions of velocity increments deviate significantly from Gaussian behavior, especially in the tails, signatures of intermittency. These findings establish SCP as a novel platform for studying viscoelastic turbulence, with broad relevance to astrophysical plasmas, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance losses, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on \\SI{1.3}{GHz} niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at \\SI{16}{MV/m}. We propose a model to explain this variation, suggesting that nitrogen more effectively traps hydrogen, thus suppressing the formation of niobium hydrides within the RF penetration layer and enabling an improved superconducting gap.",

    "title": "Polarization Transmission in the Electron-Ion Collider's Hadron Storage   Ring",
    "abstract": "The successful operation of the future Electron-Ion Collider is contingent on maintaining high hadron beam polarization up to 275 GeV. The Hadron Storage Ring lattice, however, features a symmetry-breaking interaction region that excites strong, non-systematic spin resonances, posing a significant threat to polarization preservation. This paper systematically investigates two complementary strategies to ensure high polarization transmission. The first method involves optimizing the vertical betatron phase advance between Siberian snakes to orchestrate a cancellation of depolarizing kicks across the ring. We demonstrate through simulations that both dynamic and fixed-optics solutions based on this principle can successfully preserve polarization through the strongest resonances. The second, more powerful approach involves optimizing the snake rotation axes to suppress resonance driving terms at their source. We revisit established symmetric configurations, such as the Lee-Courant schemes, and introduce a novel, highly symmetric ``Doubly Lee-Courant\" (DLC) scheme, which enforces a local \\(\\pi\\) spin phase advance across every consecutive pair of snakes. Our analysis reveals a clear performance hierarchy, with the DLC configuration providing an exceptionally robust and energy-insensitive baseline for polarization preservation. We conclude that a hybrid strategy, using a DLC snake scheme as a symmetric foundation and betatron phase tuning for fine corrections, offers the most effective path forward for the EIC and future high-energy polarized beam facilities.",

    "title": "Data-driven optimization of pixelated CdZnTe spectrometers for uranium   enrichment assay",
    "abstract": "In recent work [Vavrek et al. (2025)], we developed the performance optimization framework spectre-ml for gamma spectrometers with variable performance across many readout channels. The framework uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and clustering to learn groups of similarly-performing channels and sweep through various learned channel combinations to optimize the performance tradeoff of including worse-performing channels for better total efficiency. In this work, we integrate the pyGEM uranium enrichment assay code with our spectre-ml framework, and show that the U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization target. We find that this optimization reduces relative uncertainties after a 30-minute measurement by an average of 20%, as tested on six different H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which can significantly improve uranium non-destructive assay measurement times in nuclear safeguards contexts. Additionally, this work demonstrates that the spectre-ml optimization framework can accommodate arbitrary end-user spectroscopic analysis code and performance metrics, enabling future optimizations for complex Pu spectra.",

    "title": "Stability and optical quality of liquid crystal films as high repetition   rate plasma mirrors in staged laser-plasma accelerators",
    "abstract": "Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs), each driven by its own laser pulse, is a promising technique for reaching higher particle energies than achievable in a single LPA. However, introducing subsequent laser pulses for post-acceleration in staged LPA geometries presents a significant challenge for conventional optics. Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser beam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror surpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma mirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from high-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality, and need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the staging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of 4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new \"windmill\" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this investigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition rates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a function of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and surface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements. Our measurements demonstrate that 8CB LC films exhibit unprecedented microscopic surface quality, crucial for preserving laser pulse properties upon reflection. We also show consistent film formation suitable for operation up to 0.5 Hz with great film to film angular stability. The results allow us to conclude that 8CB LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective PMs that are suitable for coupling LPA stages.",

    "title": "Data-driven performance optimization of gamma spectrometers with many   channels",
    "abstract": "In gamma spectrometers with variable spectroscopic performance across many channels (e.g., many pixels or voxels), a tradeoff exists between including data from successively worse-performing readout channels and increasing efficiency. Brute-force calculation of the optimal set of included channels is exponentially infeasible as the number of channels grows, and approximate methods are required. In this work, we present a data-driven framework for attempting to find near-optimal sets of included detector channels. The framework leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn the behavior of gamma spectra across the detector, and clusters similarly-performing detector channels together. Performance comparisons are then made between spectra with channel clusters removed, which is more feasible than brute force. The framework is general and can be applied to arbitrary, user-defined performance metrics depending on the application. We apply this framework to optimizing gamma spectra measured by H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which exhibit variable performance across their crystal volumes. In particular, we show several examples optimizing various performance metrics for uranium and plutonium gamma spectra in nondestructive assay for nuclear safeguards, and explore trends in performance vs.\\ parameters such as clustering algorithm type. We also compare the NMF+clustering pipeline to several non-machine-learning algorithms, including several greedy algorithms. Overall, we find that the NMF+clustering pipeline tends to find the best-performing set of detector voxels, significantly improving over the un-optimized spectra, but that a greedy accumulation of spectra segmented by detector depth can in some cases give similar performance improvements in much less computation time.",

In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known.

To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.",

    "abstract": "Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.",

Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz.

In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals.

    "abstract": "Collisionless, turbulent plasmas surround the Earth, from the magnetosphere to the intergalactic medium, and the fluctuations within them affect nearly every field in the space sciences, from space weather forecasts to theories of galaxy formation. Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this compression by taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of $\\alpha \\approx -\\frac{5}{3}$ for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and $\\alpha \\approx -2$ for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a power-law spectrum, with a slope of $q \\approx 2.5$ in (non-relativistic) energy. We compare these results to those obtained from the theory and simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and discuss the astrophysical implications of this theoretical work.",

    "abstract": "The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.",

In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.",

Tuning by mechanical deformation has been a challenge with Nb$_3$Sn due to its brittle nature, however, using a set of techniques tailored to the properties of thin-film Nb$_3$Sn on Nb, we can repeatably tune the cavity to the ATLAS master clock frequency after it is cooled, while maintaining the excellent performance characteristics. The same Nb$_3$Sn cavity technology offers broad benefits for future ion accelerators.",

    "abstract": "We characterized the front-end electronics used to process high-frequency signals from low-gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. LGADs are silicon detectors employed for charged particle tracking, offering exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The purpose of this characterization was to understand how the time resolution is influenced by the front-end electronics. To achieve this, we developed a setup capable of generating input signals with varying amplitudes. The output results demonstrated that signal processing by the front-end electronics plays a crucial role in enhancing time resolution. We showed that the time resolution achieved by the FEE board is better than $2\\: ps$ at the $1\\sigma$ level.",

    "abstract": "Plasma turbulence cascading from MHD to kinetic scales in the heliospheric plasma is believed to play a key role in coronal heating and fast solar wind acceleration, but the properties of the turbulence remain poorly constrained by observations. Here we compare the ion-scale density fluctuation levels inferred from the properties of solar radio bursts with the magnetic field fluctuation levels obtained through in-situ measurements in the inner heliosphere. We find that the observed magnetic and density fluctuation amplitudes are consistent with excitation by kinetic Alfv\\'en waves and/or KAW structures over broad range of distances from the Sun. We then use the radio diagnostics and the KAW scenario to deduce the radial variation of magnetic fluctuation amplitudes in regions close to the Sun where in-situ measurements cannot be obtained. Further, we calculate the energy cascade rate (plasma heating rate) profile over a region that extends from the low corona ($\\sim 0.1$~R$_\\odot$) into the heliosphere (out to $\\sim 1$~au), and compare it to the energy deposition rate required to drive the solar wind. The cascade rate agrees with the available in-situ measurements and also provides predictions closer than $\\sim 10$~R$_\\odot$ where in-situ approaches are not available. The results provide unique diagnostics of the ion-scale plasma turbulence amplitude and energy cascade rate spanning over three orders of magnitude in solar distance.",

    "abstract": "The Full Flow Purifier for Fermilab's Muon Campus uses a charcoal bed surrounded by a liquid nitrogen jacket to purify up to 240 g/s of helium gas. Fabrication by Ability Engineering Technology Inc. has been completed and the purifier delivered to Fermilab. It is the largest purifier to be used at Fermilab based on both capacity and size. A previous paper discussed the design of purifier for various operational conditions and horizontal shipping. The purifier is designed to withstand 5g force in vertical and 2g force in lateral and longitudinal directions. Transportation experience from vendor to Fermilab and within site is discussed. Integration of the purifier involved design and fabrication of a liquid nitrogen transfer line, regeneration system, and helium piping to connect it to Muon Campus cryogenic system. It also involved establishing electrical, instrumentation and controls connections to the system. Integration of the purifier is discussed in detail. The purifier is to be commissioned using up to 4 MYCOM helium compressors to supply helium and liquid nitrogen supplied by a 60,000-liter tank. Actual effectiveness of the 3-stream heat exchanger is to be estimated based on measured temperatures and flow rate. Impurity levels will be monitored at inlet and outlet of the purifier. Theoretical adsorption capacity of the purifier is calculated based on the measured temperatures and flowrates and is compared to actual adsorption capacity over time.",

    "title": "The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries",
    "abstract": "Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.",

    "abstract": "A recently proposed Following Streamer mechanism (Feng et al. 2025 Phys. Rev. Applied 23 064039) seeks to explain how floating metal particles induce SF6 streamer breakdown in the combined gap. This mechanism is derived from a 2D axisymmetric fluid model, which has limitations in describing multiple streamer events in real-world 3D scenarios. To validate the Following Streamer mechanism, we experimentally investigate the discharge morphology of SF6 streamers induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative pulsed voltage. The results are then compared with those from 2D axisymmetric fluid simulations. The comparison reveals both consistencies and discrepancies. Regarding consistencies, experimentally observed features-such as streamer inception at both ends of the metal particle and the formation of subsequent following streamers-support the general idea of the Following Streamer mechanism. Regarding discrepancies, the experiments show a larger number of following streamers and off-axis propagation paths, which cannot be described in the 2D simulation. For scientific rigor, an extended physical model was proposed to improve the description of the Following Streamer mechanism.",

    "title": "Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux   tubes",
    "abstract": "Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.",

    "abstract": "Real-time data processing of the next generation of experiments at FAIR requires reliable event reconstruction and thus depends heavily on in-situ calibration procedures. Previously, we developed a neural-network-based approach that predicts calibration parameters from continuously available environmental and operational data and validated it on the HADES Multiwire Drift Chambers (MDCs), achieving fast predictions as accurate as offline calibrations. In this work, we introduce several methodological improvements that enhance both accuracy and the ability to adapt to new data. These include changes to the input features, better offline calibration and trainable normalizations. Furthermore, by combining beam-time and cosmic-ray datasets, we demonstrate that the learned dependencies can be transferred between very different data-taking scenarios. This enables the network not only to provide real-time calibration predictions, but also to infer optimal high-voltage settings, thus establishing a practical framework for a real-time detector control during data acquisition process.",

    "abstract": "Atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) is a promising technology for long-term orbit maintenance in very-low-Earth orbit. The intake device plays a crucial role in capturing and supplying propellant, and its capture efficiency is a key indicator of drag-compensation feasibility. For experimental evaluation, an electric-propulsion (EP) plasma plume can be used as a particle-flow generator to simulate the VLEO atmosphere in ground facilities. This study numerically investigates the interaction of an EP plasma plume with an intake device to establish guidelines for measuring capture efficiency in conventional vacuum facilities. A hybrid PIC-DSMC method with ion-surface interaction models is employed to simulate the plasma plume incident on the intake. The composition of the captured flow is governed by beam-ion energy and species mass: lowering the energy and using lighter atmospheric constituents increase plume divergence and promote neutralization, yielding a neutral-dominated outlet flow. Sputtering of the intake surface becomes non-negligible at high energies but can be mitigated by operating at appropriately low beam energies. The results show that simultaneous ion and neutral diagnostics are required for reliable capture-efficiency evaluation when using EP plasma plumes in ground facilities.",

    "abstract": "We present an approach for the CVD growth of diamond, where the sample is placed in a defined distance from the reactor baseplate, to which the plasma couples. We observe two previously unknown growth regimes. In the first case, the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma, leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for diamond-based electronics.",

The impact of the bound-state computation by three different parametric potentials is investigated within the Garbet formalism for the mean excitation energy. The first parametric potential is due to Green, Sellin and Zachor, the second one was proposed by Yunta, and the third one was introduced by Klapisch in the framework of atomic-structure computations.

We determine a damage constant of $3.9 \\times 10^{-17}$ A/cm at 17 C$^\\circ$ immediately after irradiation, which drops significantly to approximately 40% of the initial value in 200 hours, then stabilizes to approximately 30% of the initial value in 1000 hours. We measure sensor noise and signal charge for a sensor irradiated with the equivalent 1-MeV-neutron fluence of $3.0\\times 10^{13}~{\\rm n}_{\\rm eq}/{\\rm cm^2}$. Noise increases by approximately 44% after irradiation, while signal charge does not change significantly when a sufficiently high bias voltage is applied.",

    "title": "Studies of simulation framework for NνDEx experiment",
    "abstract": "The N$\\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy resolution through direct charge collection.   In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\\nu$DEx ion TPC. The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding values of $0.444 \\pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \\pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively.   The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an 10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on drift time differences and Breadth First search.   To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and sensitivity studies in the N$\\nu$DEx experiment.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction is a crucial simulation capability for interpreting diagnostic measurements of experimental plasmas. Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $\\beta = 2\\mu_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$\\beta$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $\\beta$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.",

    "abstract": "We present the first language-model-driven agentic artificial intelligence (AI) system to autonomously execute multi-stage physics experiments on a production synchrotron light source. Implemented at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator, the system translates natural language user prompts into structured execution plans that combine archive data retrieval, control-system channel resolution, automated script generation, controlled machine interaction, and analysis. In a representative machine physics task, we show that preparation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude relative to manual scripting even for a system expert, while operator-standard safety constraints were strictly upheld. Core architectural features, plan-first orchestration, bounded tool access, and dynamic capability selection, enable transparent, auditable execution with fully reproducible artifacts. These results establish a blueprint for the safe integration of agentic AI into accelerator experiments and demanding machine physics studies, as well as routine operations, with direct portability across accelerators worldwide and, more broadly, to other large-scale scientific infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "Using a two-fluid approach, we consider the properties of relativistically nonlinear (arbitrary $a_0$), circularly polarized electromagnetic waves propagating along magnetic field in electron-ion and pair plasmas. Dispersion relations depend on how wave intensity scales with frequency, $a_0 (\\omega)$. For superluminal branches, the nonlinear effects reduce the cut-off frequency, while the general form of the dispersion relations $\\omega(k)$ remains similar to the linear case. For subluminal waves, whistlers and Alfven, a new effect appears: dispersion curves effectively terminate at finite $\\omega^\\ast - k^\\ast$ due to current starvation. Qualitatively, subluminal modes with fluctuating electric field larger than the guide field, $E_w (\\omega) \\geq B_0$, cannot propagate.",

    "title": "Gas-jet target with online interferometric thickness measurement for   nuclear astrophysics",
    "abstract": "A new jet gas target system has been developed for the Felsenkeller 5 MV underground ion accelerator for nuclear astrophysics. It provides either a 1.5$\\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ thick cylindrical jet or a 7$\\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ thick wall of nitrogen gas, with a surface of 10$\\times$10 mm$^2$ to be seen by the ion beam. The system includes a de Laval type nozzle and altogether five pumping stages: In addition to the jet catcher and the jet chamber surrounding it, there are three stages connecting the jet to the ion accelerator. Behind the jet chamber, as seen from the ion beam, a windowless static-type gas target and, subsequently, a beam calorimeter have been installed.   This work describes the offline tests of the gas target system prior to its installation on the beam line of the Felsenkeller accelerator. The thickness of the jet has been determined using three different methods: By computational fluid dynamics simulations, with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and by $\\alpha$-energy loss using a mixed $\\alpha$ source. The three methods were shown to be in agreement. For 0-6 bar inlet gas pressure, a linear relationship between inlet pressure and jet thickness has been found. Different shapes of de Laval type inlet nozzles, both circular and slit-type, have been manufactured from fused silica glass or stainless steel and tested using measurements and simulations. The power and stability of the beam calorimeter have been tested. The interferometry has been shown to work reliably and to give two-dimensional projections of the gas jet with sub-mm resolution.",

    "title": "The Nature of Turbulence at Sub-Electron Scales in the Solar Wind",
    "abstract": "The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\\rho_e$ scales.",

    "title": "Magnetic flux ropes within reconnection exhausts close to the centers of   heliospheric current sheets near the Sun",
    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between magnetic flux ropes and magnetic reconnection is fundamental to both space and astrophysical plasma studies. In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by ~10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of ~12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are <20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by <10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.",
