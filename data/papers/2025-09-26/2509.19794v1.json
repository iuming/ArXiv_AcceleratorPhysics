  "title": "Controls Abstraction Towards Accelerator Physics: A Middle Layer Python   Package for Particle Accelerator Control",
  "abstract": "Control system middle layers act as a co-ordination and communication bridge between end users, including operators, system experts, scientists, and experimental users, and the low-level control system interface. This article describes a Python package -- Controls Abstraction Towards Acclerator Physics (CATAP) -- which aims to build on previous experience and provide a modern Python-based middle layer with explicit abstraction, YAML-based configuration, and procedural code generation. CATAP provides a structured and coherent interface to a control system, allowing researchers and operators to centralize higher-level control logic and device information. This greatly reduces the amount of code that a user must write to perform a task, and codifies system knowledge that is usually anecdotal. The CATAP design has been deployed at two accelerator facilities, and has been developed to produce a procedurally generated facility-specific middle layer package from configuration files to enable its wider dissemination across other machines.",
