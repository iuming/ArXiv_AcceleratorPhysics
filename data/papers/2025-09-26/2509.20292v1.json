  "title": "Matching Optimization for TRIUMF's Rare Isotope Linac",
  "abstract": "Fringe field effects are computed from simulated and measured quadrupole magnetic field gradients, enabling a more realistic modelling of the medium energy section optics in TRIUMF's RIB postaccelerator. Quantifying the fringe field optics using the method developed by Matsuda and Wollnik allows for the use of parallel modelling tune optimizations for machine operation, providing operators with an efficient means to re-tune the variable energy drift tube linac for RIB delivery.",
