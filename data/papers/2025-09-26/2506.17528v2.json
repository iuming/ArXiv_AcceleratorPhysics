  "title": "A class of high-beta, large-aspect-ratio quasiaxisymmetric Palumbo-like   configurations",
  "abstract": "The space of high-beta, approximately quasiaxisymmetric, large-aspect-ratio stellarator configurations is explored using an inverse coordinate approach and a quadratic polynomial ansatz for the flux function, following the method of Palumbo, extended by Hernandes and Clemente. This approach yields a system of nonlinear ODEs that, when solved, give equilibria exhibiting positive or negative triangularity, cusps, and (in an extreme limit) current singularities. It is shown that a cubic ansatz may also be used, but that polynomials of degree four or higher will lead to overdetermination.",
