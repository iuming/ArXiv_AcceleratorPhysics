  "title": "Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV   protons",
  "abstract": "Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.",
