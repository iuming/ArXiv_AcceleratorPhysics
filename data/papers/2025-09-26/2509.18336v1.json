  "title": "Single shot multi-time frame imaging of plasmas with a frequency tagged   GHz pulse train",
  "abstract": "Studying plasma dynamics is crucial for understanding processes like inertial confinement fusion, material damage, and shockwave formation from intense laser or current interactions. While pump-probe methods are standard for capturing these dynamics, single-shot experiments using high-power, low-repetition-rate systems with custom targets are challenging. We present a novel imaging technique using a synchronized GHz-rate spectrally tagged probe laser to capture multiple time-resolved snapshots from a single pump event.",
