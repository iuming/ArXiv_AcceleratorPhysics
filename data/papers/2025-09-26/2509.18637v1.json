  "title": "Assessing the operating characteristics of an ion-milled phonon-mediated   quantum parity detector",
  "abstract": "Phonon sensitive superconducting qubits promise to provide sub-eV energy deposit thresholds, useful for future rare-event experiments looking for interactions from dark matter and neutrinos. We detail here engineering results from a Quantum Parity Detector (QPDs), one of a class of phonon sensitive qubits, and, as a first measurement, show that this device has a quiescent quasiparticle density of $1.8 \\pm 0.8 \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, in line with expectation. We also outline an argon ion-mill process for multi-step Josephson Junction fabrication, expanding the sparse literature on this topic, which proves useful in avoiding secondary parasitic junctions.",
