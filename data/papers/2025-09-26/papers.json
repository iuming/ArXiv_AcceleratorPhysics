    "title": "Probing Beyond the Standard Model Scenarios in Long-baseline and   Astrophysical Neutrino Experiments",
    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, outstanding progress in the neutrino experiment frontier has greatly advanced our understanding of the flavor oscillations of active neutrinos. The remaining key questions such as the neutrino mass ordering, the presence of CP violation in the lepton sector, and the octant of $\\theta_{23}$ are expected to be resolved in the coming years. The current precise knowledge of neutrino mass and mixing parameters, together with the promising prospects of next-generation neutrino experiments, provides a unique opportunity to test scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) through neutrino oscillation phenomena. This thesis investigates several such BSM scenarios and examines the capability of the next-generation neutrino experiments to probe them.",

    "abstract": "The fast volumetric deposition of multi-MeV high current runaway electron (RE) beams constitutes the most critical issue for the ITER tungsten (W) first wall (FW) longevity. Such relativistic electron beams could generate extreme volumetric power densities inside the FW armour which lead to significant vaporization, deep melting and even material explosions, as well as to elevated temperatures at the bond interface with the cooling substrate that could cause rupture and water leaks. Here the thermal response of the ITER FW is modeled with a three-stage, one-way coupled workflow focusing on assessments of the extent of the wall damage and the increase of the bond interface temperature for varying W thickness. Increased W thickness is found to be essential for wall protection against intense RE dissipation events in terms of both W tile damage and cooling system integrity.",

    "abstract": "COSINUS is a dark matter direct detection experiment using NaI crystals as cryogenic scintillating calorimeters. If no signal is observed, this will constrain the dark matter scattering rate in sodium iodide. We investigate how this constraint can be used to infer that the annual modulation signal observed in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment cannot originate from dark matter nuclear recoil events, independently of the dark matter model. We achieve this by unfolding the DAMA modulation spectrum to obtain the implied unquenched nuclear recoil spectrum, which we then compare to the expected COSINUS sensitivity. We find that assuming zero background in the signal region, a 1$\\sigma$, 2$\\sigma$ or 3$\\sigma$ confidence limit exclusion can be obtained with 57, 130 or 250 kg day of exposure, respectively. A simple background model indicates that in the presence of background, the exposure requirements may increase by $\\sim30\\%$.",

    "title": "Feedforward equilibrium trajectory optimization with GSPulse",
    "abstract": "One of the common tasks required for designing new plasma scenarios or evaluating capabilities of a tokamak is to design the desired equilibria using a Grad-Shafranov (GS) equilibrium solver. However, most standard equilibrium solvers are time-independent and do not include dynamic effects such as plasma current flux consumption, induced vessel currents, or voltage constraints. Another class of tools, plasma equilibrium evolution simulators, do include time-dependent effects. These are generally structured to solve the forward problem of evolving the plasma equilibrium given feedback-controlled voltages. In this work, we introduce GSPulse, a novel algorithm for equilibrium trajectory optimization, that is more akin to a pulse planner than a pulse simulator. GSPulse includes time-dependent effects and solves the inverse problem: given a user-specified set of target equilibrium shapes, as well as limits on the coil currents and voltages, the optimizer returns trajectories of the voltages, currents, and achievable equilibria. This task is useful for scoping performance of a tokamak and exploring the space of achievable pulses. The computed equilibria satisfy both Grad-Shafranov force balance and axisymmetric circuit dynamics. The optimization is performed by restructuring the free-boundary equilibrium evolution (FBEE) equations into a form where it is computationally efficient to optimize the entire dynamic sequence. GSPulse can solve for hundreds of equilibria simultaneously within a few minutes. GSPulse has been validated against NSTX-U and MAST-U experiments and against SPARC feedback control simulations, and is being used to perform scenario design for SPARC. The computed trajectories can be used as feedforward inputs to inform and improve feedback performance. The code for GSPulse is available open-source at https://github.com/jwai-cfs/GSPulse_public.",

    "title": "Residual energy of magnetohydrodynamic shocks",
    "abstract": "Residual energy quantifies the difference in energy between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in a plasma. Recent observational evidence highlights that fast-mode interplanetary shock waves have positive residual energy, in sharp contrast to the negative residual energy of the turbulence and magnetic structures that constitute the vast majority of fluctuation power in the solar wind at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) inertial scales. In this work, we apply the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to derive an equation for the residual energy of an MHD shock jump as a function of the shock angle, density compression ratio and Alfv\\'en Mach number upstream of the shock. An equation for the cross helicity is similarly derived. The residual energy equation gives only positive values for super-Alfv\\'enic (i.e. fast-mode) shocks. The residual energy and cross helicity of slow-mode shocks and tangential, contact and rotational discontinuities are also determined. A simplified form of the residual energy equation applicable to perpendicular shocks has been verified against residual energy values directly estimated from observations of 141 interplanetary shocks; the equation is found to match well with observations, particularly for shocks with higher density compression ratios and Mach numbers. The use of positive residual energy as a signature for fast-mode shock identification in spacecraft data is briefly considered, and insights from this work relating to compressive fluctuations more generally in the solar wind are discussed.",

    "title": "Studies on Response Uniformity of RPC and Exploring Oscillation Dip and   Valley, Non-Standard Interactions, and Earth's Core using Atmospheric   Neutrinos at ICAL-INO detector",
    "abstract": "In this thesis, experimental and physics simulation studies are performed in the context of the proposed 50 kt Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). ICAL would detect atmospheric muon neutrinos and antineutrinos separately in the multi-GeV range of energies over a wide range of baselines. In the experimental part of the thesis, the effect of the non-uniformity of the graphite layer on the detector response of the resistive plate chamber is studied. In the physics simulation part, it is demonstrated for the first time that the neutrino oscillation dip and valley can be observed at ICAL using the up/down ratio of reconstructed muons and antimuons separately. A method is formulated such that the location of the dip and the alignment of the valley can be used to measure an atmospheric oscillation parameter called the mass-squared difference. Further, a new approach is proposed to probe the neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSIs) using the oscillation dip and valley. The opposite shifts in the oscillation dips and the contrast in the curvatures of oscillation valleys for reconstructed muons and antimuons are used to constrain the NSI parameter in two separate ways. While passing through the Earth, the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos experience the matter effects, which modify the neutrino oscillation patterns. These matter effects depend upon the density of electrons inside Earth and can be used to perform the neutrino oscillation tomography of Earth, complementary to gravitational measurements and seismic studies. This work demonstrates that the presence of Earth's core can be validated using the atmospheric neutrinos at ICAL.",

A prototype was constructed and rigorously evaluated using scintillators, achieving timing resolutions of about 13 ps for a single calibration channel. Furthermore, internal deviations among calibration channels were analyzed, with most measurements remaining within 250 ps. These results highlight the system's precision, scalability, and suitability for large-scale particle physics experiments.",

    "title": "Rapid muon tomography for border security",
    "abstract": "Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.",

In this lecture, Thermal, Electrical and Magnetic properties are briefly introduced, highlighting the mechanisms governing variation with temperature and magnetic field. Standards and testing methods for different properties are described, illustrated with practical examples. With regard to the characterization of thermal properties of a material, testing methods of heat capacity and thermal conductivity are described, with details of the main working principle and measurement examples. Determination of electrical resistivity and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) are the main characteristics of electrical properties, together with specific characterization of superconducting materials. Testing magnetic properties deserve special attention; different methods are commonly employed to characterize non-magnetic and magnetic materials. In magnetic metals and ferrites non-linear behavior and hysteresis effects need to be considered in order to assess their suitability for applications or to model material performance.",

    "title": "Conceptual design of a Doppler Backscattering diagnostic for the EXL-50U   spherical tokamak",
    "abstract": "The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $<$ $\\rho$ $<$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$<$ $k_{\\perp}$ $<$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\\rho$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\\sim35^{\\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).",

    "abstract": "Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\\%} = 29.97 \\pm 0.24\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\\%} = 18.63 \\pm 0.24\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \\pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.",

Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfv\\'enic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfv\\'enic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.",

    "title": "Energy transfer from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion   acoustic waves",
    "abstract": "Large-amplitude slow-mode waves are commonly observed near Earth's magnetopause. Recent observations show that these waves can occur simultaneously with kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves. The amplitude of the ion acoustic waves is enhanced near the magnetic field peaks of the slow-mode wave, suggesting that the slow-mode waves may drive the generation of ion acoustic waves. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a hybrid simulation using observation-based parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that large-amplitude slow-mode waves generate counter-streaming ion beams, which in turn excite ion acoustic waves and relax the ion beams. Our study reveals a clear energy transfer channel from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves.",

    "title": "Anisotropic momentum distributions due to radiation recoil in   relativistic plasmas with electric and magnetic fields",
    "abstract": "The interaction of strong electromagnetic fields with plasma generates radiation accompanied by a recoil force, which can significantly alter the plasma dynamics. In this work, we investigate the development of anisotropic momentum distributions induced by the combined action of electric and magnetic fields on a thermally relativistic plasma. We consider three distinct types of anisotropy. The first arises from a pure magnetic field acting on plasma with either isotropic or anisotropic initial momentum distributions, producing the characteristic ring-shaped momentum profile. The second is driven by a pure electric field, where radiation reaction generates a partial, anisotropic ring distribution in momentum space: significant modifications occur primarily in the 90$^\\circ$--180$^\\circ$ and 270$^\\circ$--360$^\\circ$ sectors of the $p_x$--$p_y$ plane, while the remaining quadrants remain largely unaffected. The third case considers the combined effect of electric and magnetic fields. When the cyclotron frequency is very close to the upper hybrid frequency, the azimuthal symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution is broken. Conversely, in the regime where the cyclotron frequency is lower than the upper hybrid frequency, the rapid oscillations of the electric field dominate and preserve the symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution.",

    "abstract": "Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.",

    "abstract": "Oscillatory reconnection is a dynamic, magnetic relaxation mechanism in which a perturbed null point reverts back to equilibrium via time-dependent reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the long-term periodic signal generated by a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null point, when it is perturbed by a non-periodic driver, for a variety of driving amplitudes. We solve the 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using a bespoke numerical boundary condition (a sponge region) that damps wave reflections and thus allows the long-term periodic signal at the 3D null point to be investigated. We observe multiple cycles of the 3D oscillatory reconnection mechanism for the first time. We find that the periodicity is both constant and independent of the choice of driving amplitude. Furthermore, the resultant time-dependent current density at the null point normalized by the driving amplitude is invariant. We extract a single period for oscillatory reconnection at a 3D null point, opening the future possibility of using this characteristic period as a diagnostic tool to reveal indirectly the fundamental plasma properties of 3D null points.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the non-ideal Ohm's law is integrated in the mixed variable-pullback scheme for the gyrokinetic particle simulations. This scheme captures the evolution of the symplectic solution of the gyrokinetic model accurately not only in the MHD limit but also in the electrostatic limit. This scheme also provides a pure symplectic ($v_\\shortparallel $) scheme for electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle simulations without causing the traditional cancellation problem in the pure Hamiltonian scheme. Various mixed variable schemes have been comprehensively analyzed for the 1D shear Alfv\\`en wave problem with kinetic electrons, with the connection to the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme and the symplectic scheme. It is demonstrated that the pure $v_\\shortparallel $ form with the non-ideal Ohm's law has comparable performance to the widely used mixed variable-pullback scheme with the ideal Ohm's law. The mixed variable-pullback scheme without Ohm's law is also proposed as a feasible improvement of the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme with minimum modification and considerable performance improvement in terms of a marker number reduction.",

    "title": "Nature of Transonic Sub-Alfvénic Turbulence and Density Fluctuations   in the Near-Sun Solar Wind: Insights from Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations and   Nearly-Incompressible Models",
    "abstract": "Recent Parker Solar Probe measurements have revealed that solar wind (SW) turbulence transits from a subsonic to a transonic regime near the Sun, while remaining sub-Alfv\\'enic. These observations call for a revision of existing SW models, where turbulence is considered to be both subsonic and sub-Alfv\\'enic. In this Letter, we introduce a new magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of Transonic sub-Alfv\\'enic Turbulence (TsAT). Our model shows that turbulence is effectively nearly-incompressible (NI) and has a 2D + slab geometry not only in the subsonic limit, but also in the transonic regime, as long as it remains sub-Alfv\\'enic, a condition essentially enforced everywhere in the heliosphere by the strong local magnetic field. These predictions are consistent with 3D MHD simulations, showing that transonic turbulence is dominated by low frequency quasi-2D incompressible structures, while compressible fluctuations are a minor component corresponding to low frequency slow modes and high frequency fast modes. Our new TsAT model extends existing NI theories of turbulence, and is potentially relevant for the theoretical and numerical modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas, including the near-Sun SW, the solar corona, and the interstellar medium.",

    "abstract": "We present the first experimental measurements of the toroidal mode number of shear Alfv\\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator. A series of experiments were carried out in three different magnetic configurations to investigate counter-NBI driven modes. Co- and counter- electron-cyclotron current drive was used to modify the rotational transform (\\iotabar) profile leading to the destabilization of a varied set of Alfv\\'en eigenmodes with different frequencies and mode numbers. To characterize the spatial structure of the modes we have used two Mirnov probe arrays, one dedicated to the measurement of the poloidal mode number and the other, a recently commissioned helical tri-axial array, dedicated to the measurement of the toroidal mode number. A heavy ion beam probe, operated in radial sweep mode, was employed to characterize the radial location of the modes. We show that the induced changes in \\iotabar, that are fundamental when it comes to validation studies, cannot be measured experimentally with motional Stark effect so, instead, the shielding current diffusion equation is solved in cylindrical geometry to estimate these changes. We calculate the incompressible shear Alfv\\'en continuum for selected cases using \\texttt{STELLGAP} and find reasonable consistency with observations. A database with the observed modes has been created, so that it can be used in future work for theory validation purposes.",

    "title": "On the Overestimation of Efficiency in Relativistic Electron Scattering",
    "abstract": "Recent reviews in ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) have claimed that relativistic electrons exhibit enhanced elastic scattering efficiency, frequently quantified as a \\gamma^2 increase in the differential cross section. These claims, however, originate from angular-domain analyses that overlook the compression of scattering angles \\theta with increasing electron energy, leading to an apparent, but artificial, enhancement. In this work, we recast the problem in momentum-transfer space q, where scattering is accurately accounted for. This transformation eliminates the angular compression artefact and reveals that high-energy scaling follows a simple \\beta^{-2} dependence, with no intrinsic relativistic gain. We demonstrate this by directly integrating relativistic differential elastic-scattering cross sections from ELSEPA and by applying a straightforward transformation of the well-known Mott-Massey formalism into q-space. The results are general, with calculations performed for elements from carbon to gold and for energies between 50 keV and 5000 keV. They reproduce the long-established trend in total elastic scattering cross sections, in which scattering strength decreases with increasing electron kinetic energy. Practically, at energies above roughly 50 keV, scattering is already dominated by the forward direction, and most of the scattered intensity falls within the acceptance range of typical UED detectors. These findings correct a widespread misconception in the UED literature and provide a more accurate and intuitive framework for interpreting and optimizing high-energy electron scattering experiments.",

    "abstract": "One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \\varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.",

    "title": "Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-Pérot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter   Detection",
    "abstract": "Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\\gamma} \\gtrsim 3\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.",

    "abstract": "The CEPC clock issue is related with the RF frequency coordination between the various accelerator systems and may affect the operation modes of both the accelerator and the detector. The timing structure of CEPC has been restudied with the collaboration of the accelerator team and the detector team. After discussions between two sides, the CEPC bunch structure is set such that the spacings between adjacent bunches in any CEPC operation mode are integer numbers of 23.08 ns. The master CEPC clock will be provided by the accelerator to the detector systems with a frequency of 43.33 MHz, synchronous to the beam. The CEPC detector system relies on the clock to sample physics signal at the right time. It was found that if the circumference of CEPC is slightly changed to 99955.418 m, not only is the orbit length closer to 100 km, but also the detector would benefit more for the first 10-year operation.",

    "abstract": "Limited radiation hardness is the primary drawback to implementing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) in high-luminosity environments, such as the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment. Hadron irradiation generates defects in the silicon lattice of SiPMs, increasing dark current, dark count rate (DCR), crosstalk, and afterpulsing, while degrading gain and photon resolution. The expected radiation dose in the photon camera of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the CBM experiment ranges from $8\\times 10^9$ to $5\\times 10^{10}$ n$_{\\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$ after two-months of operation at maximum beam energy and intensity. In this work, we evaluated the radiation hardness of three different SiPMs: AFBR-S4N66P024M, S14160-6050HS, and MICROFC-60035. The samples were exposed to neutron irradiation with doses ranging from $3\\times 10^8$ to $1\\times 10^{11}$ n$_{\\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$. The neutron radiation damage was found to increase the SiPM dark current up to $10^3$ times, DCR up to $10^2$ times, and afterpulsing up to $10\\%$ while decreasing their gain and photon resolution. We performed electrical annealing (250 $^{\\circ}$C/30 min) on the samples to recover the photon resolution and decrease the DCR and dark current.",

Here, oblique high velocity tungsten-on-tungsten mechanical impacts are reproduced in a controlled manner by a two-stage light gas gun shooting system.

We report the first observation of intermittent viscoelastic turbulence in such plasmas using large-scale three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations. In driven dissipative SCP, we observe scale-dependent flow dynamics arising from the interplay between potential (elastic) and viscous dissipation at the particle level. Unlike conventional turbulence, governed by inertia and viscosity, SCP exhibits distinct energy transfer processes due to its intrinsic viscoelasticity. Both kinetic and elastic energy spectra show power-law scaling $E(k), \\Phi(k) \\propto k^{-3.5}$. In real space, velocity structure functions display nontrivial scaling, and the probability distribution functions of velocity increments deviate significantly from Gaussian behavior, especially in the tails, signatures of intermittency. These findings establish SCP as a novel platform for studying viscoelastic turbulence, with broad relevance to astrophysical plasmas, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance losses, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on \\SI{1.3}{GHz} niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at \\SI{16}{MV/m}. We propose a model to explain this variation, suggesting that nitrogen more effectively traps hydrogen, thus suppressing the formation of niobium hydrides within the RF penetration layer and enabling an improved superconducting gap.",

    "title": "Polarization Transmission in the Electron-Ion Collider's Hadron Storage   Ring",
    "abstract": "The successful operation of the future Electron-Ion Collider is contingent on maintaining high hadron beam polarization up to 275 GeV. The Hadron Storage Ring lattice, however, features a symmetry-breaking interaction region that excites strong, non-systematic spin resonances, posing a significant threat to polarization preservation. This paper systematically investigates two complementary strategies to ensure high polarization transmission. The first method involves optimizing the vertical betatron phase advance between Siberian snakes to orchestrate a cancellation of depolarizing kicks across the ring. We demonstrate through simulations that both dynamic and fixed-optics solutions based on this principle can successfully preserve polarization through the strongest resonances. The second, more powerful approach involves optimizing the snake rotation axes to suppress resonance driving terms at their source. We revisit established symmetric configurations, such as the Lee-Courant schemes, and introduce a novel, highly symmetric ``Doubly Lee-Courant\" (DLC) scheme, which enforces a local \\(\\pi\\) spin phase advance across every consecutive pair of snakes. Our analysis reveals a clear performance hierarchy, with the DLC configuration providing an exceptionally robust and energy-insensitive baseline for polarization preservation. We conclude that a hybrid strategy, using a DLC snake scheme as a symmetric foundation and betatron phase tuning for fine corrections, offers the most effective path forward for the EIC and future high-energy polarized beam facilities.",

The framework uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and clustering to learn groups of similarly-performing channels and sweep through various learned channel combinations to optimize the performance tradeoff of including worse-performing channels for better total efficiency. In this work, we integrate the pyGEM uranium enrichment assay code with our spectre-ml framework, and show that the U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization target. We find that this optimization reduces relative uncertainties after a 30-minute measurement by an average of 20%, as tested on six different H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which can significantly improve uranium non-destructive assay measurement times in nuclear safeguards contexts. Additionally, this work demonstrates that the spectre-ml optimization framework can accommodate arbitrary end-user spectroscopic analysis code and performance metrics, enabling future optimizations for complex Pu spectra.",

    "abstract": "Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs), each driven by its own laser pulse, is a promising technique for reaching higher particle energies than achievable in a single LPA. However, introducing subsequent laser pulses for post-acceleration in staged LPA geometries presents a significant challenge for conventional optics. Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser beam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror surpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma mirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from high-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality, and need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the staging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of 4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new \"windmill\" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this investigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition rates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a function of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and surface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements. Our measurements demonstrate that 8CB LC films exhibit unprecedented microscopic surface quality, crucial for preserving laser pulse properties upon reflection. We also show consistent film formation suitable for operation up to 0.5 Hz with great film to film angular stability. The results allow us to conclude that 8CB LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective PMs that are suitable for coupling LPA stages.",

    "title": "Data-driven performance optimization of gamma spectrometers with many   channels",
    "abstract": "In gamma spectrometers with variable spectroscopic performance across many channels (e.g., many pixels or voxels), a tradeoff exists between including data from successively worse-performing readout channels and increasing efficiency. Brute-force calculation of the optimal set of included channels is exponentially infeasible as the number of channels grows, and approximate methods are required. In this work, we present a data-driven framework for attempting to find near-optimal sets of included detector channels. The framework leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn the behavior of gamma spectra across the detector, and clusters similarly-performing detector channels together. Performance comparisons are then made between spectra with channel clusters removed, which is more feasible than brute force. The framework is general and can be applied to arbitrary, user-defined performance metrics depending on the application. We apply this framework to optimizing gamma spectra measured by H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which exhibit variable performance across their crystal volumes. In particular, we show several examples optimizing various performance metrics for uranium and plutonium gamma spectra in nondestructive assay for nuclear safeguards, and explore trends in performance vs.\\ parameters such as clustering algorithm type. We also compare the NMF+clustering pipeline to several non-machine-learning algorithms, including several greedy algorithms. Overall, we find that the NMF+clustering pipeline tends to find the best-performing set of detector voxels, significantly improving over the un-optimized spectra, but that a greedy accumulation of spectra segmented by detector depth can in some cases give similar performance improvements in much less computation time.",

    "title": "Automatic Model Extraction of the Match Standard in   Symmetric--Reciprocal--Match Calibration",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.",

    "title": "Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV   protons",
    "abstract": "Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.",

    "abstract": "The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.",

    "title": "Efficient Particle Acceleration in 2.5-Dimensional, Hybrid-Kinetic   Simulations of Decaying, Supersonic, Plasma Turbulence",
    "abstract": "Collisionless, turbulent plasmas surround the Earth, from the magnetosphere to the intergalactic medium, and the fluctuations within them affect nearly every field in the space sciences, from space weather forecasts to theories of galaxy formation. Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this compression by taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of $\\alpha \\approx -\\frac{5}{3}$ for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and $\\alpha \\approx -2$ for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a power-law spectrum, with a slope of $q \\approx 2.5$ in (non-relativistic) energy. We compare these results to those obtained from the theory and simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and discuss the astrophysical implications of this theoretical work.",

    "title": "Microphysical Regulation of Non-Ideal MHD in Weakly-Ionized Systems:   Does the Hall Effect Matter?",
    "abstract": "The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.",

    "abstract": "Context. In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.",

The module utilizes the pre-shower characteristics of the front-end scintillator units to ensure sufficient energy deposition in the silicon pixel layers, thereby maintaining its high-precision detection capability. A dedicated simulation framework combining Geant4 modeling for the scintillator section and a parameterized approach for the silicon pixel layer is employed for module verification and performance study. The hybrid module demonstrates overall performance enhancement. The maximum achievable improvements are 56\\% for position resolution and 26\\% for time resolution, respectively.
