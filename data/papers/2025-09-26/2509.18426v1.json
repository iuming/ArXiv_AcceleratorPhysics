  "title": "Automatic Model Extraction of the Match Standard in   Symmetric--Reciprocal--Match Calibration",
  "abstract": "This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.",
