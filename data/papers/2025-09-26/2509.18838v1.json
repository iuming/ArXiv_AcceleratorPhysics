  "title": "Neutron irradiation damage on Silicon Photomultipliers and electrical   annealing studies for the CBM RICH detector",
  "abstract": "Limited radiation hardness is the primary drawback to implementing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) in high-luminosity environments, such as the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment. Hadron irradiation generates defects in the silicon lattice of SiPMs, increasing dark current, dark count rate (DCR), crosstalk, and afterpulsing, while degrading gain and photon resolution. The expected radiation dose in the photon camera of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the CBM experiment ranges from $8\\times 10^9$ to $5\\times 10^{10}$ n$_{\\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$ after two-months of operation at maximum beam energy and intensity. In this work, we evaluated the radiation hardness of three different SiPMs: AFBR-S4N66P024M, S14160-6050HS, and MICROFC-60035. The samples were exposed to neutron irradiation with doses ranging from $3\\times 10^8$ to $1\\times 10^{11}$ n$_{\\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$. The neutron radiation damage was found to increase the SiPM dark current up to $10^3$ times, DCR up to $10^2$ times, and afterpulsing up to $10\\%$ while decreasing their gain and photon resolution. We performed electrical annealing (250 $^{\\circ}$C/30 min) on the samples to recover the photon resolution and decrease the DCR and dark current.",
