  "title": "Plasma hydrodynamics from mean force kinetic theory",
  "abstract": "Mean force kinetic theory is used to evaluate the electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, electrothermal coefficient, thermoelectric coefficient, and shear viscosity of a two-component (ion-electron) plasma. Results are compared with molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations are made possible by assuming a repulsive Coulomb force for all interactions. Good agreement is found for all coefficients up to a Coulomb coupling strength of $Γ\\approx 20$. This is over 100-times larger than the coupling strength at which traditional theories break down. It is concluded that mean force kinetic theory provides a means to extend hydrodynamics to dense plasmas.",
