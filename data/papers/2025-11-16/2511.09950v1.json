  "title": "$π$-PIC: a framework for modular particle-in-cell developments and simulations",
  "abstract": "Recently proposed modifications of the standard particle-in-cell (PIC) method resolve long-standing limitations such as exact preservation of physically conserved quantities and unbiased ensemble down-sampling. Such advances pave the way for next-generation PIC codes capable of using lower resolution and fewer particles per cell, enabling interactive studies on personal computers and facilitating large-scale parameter scans on supercomputers. Here, we present a Python-controlled framework designed to stimulate the dissemination and adoption of novel PIC developments by providing unified interfaces for accommodation, cross-testing, and comparison of PIC solvers and extensions written in Python or low-level languages like C++ and Fortran. To demonstrate flexibility of proposed interfaces we present and test implementations of several PIC solvers, as well as of extensions that is capable of managing QED processes, moving-window, and tight focusing of laser pulses.",
