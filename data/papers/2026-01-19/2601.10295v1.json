  "title": "Design, Fabrication and Testing of a D-Shaped High Temperature Superconducting Magnet",
  "abstract": "High-temperature technical superconductors are potential candidates for compact and high-field tokamak magnets. The demand for higher fusion power can be met with an on-axis high magnetic field due to toroidal magnets. An R&D activity has been initiated at the Institute for Plasma Research, India, to develop a compact D-shaped superconducting magnet utilizing REBCO high-temperature superconducting tapes. Under this initiative, a toroidal configuration with a major radius of 0.42 m, consisting of eight D-shaped, four poloidal field, and a central solenoid high-temperature superconducting magnets producing an on-axis toroidal magnetic field of 0.23 T has been conceptualized. The fabrication feasibility of a D-shaped coil for this toroidal configuration also envisaged using stacked high-temperature superconducting cable. In this paper, we report the design of a compact D-shaped coil, the fabrication of a long length HTS cable, a winding pack, and its integration with a cryogenic casing and vacuum enclosure. The winding pack terminations, joints, its interfacing with the power supply, and performance testing are also reported in this paper.",
