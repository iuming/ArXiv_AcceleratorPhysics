  "title": "The ePIC Silicon Vertex Tracker: Design and Status",
  "abstract": "The ePIC collaboration is developing a multidetector system to explore the fundamental properties of the strong interaction at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A key component of the ePIC detector is the Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT), which provides high-precision tracking and microvertex reconstruction. The SVT consists of the Inner Barrel (IB), the Outer Barrel (OB), and the Forward/Backward Disks, all based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) that combine high granularity, low power consumption, and minimal material budget. This paper presents a concise overview of the SVT design and its development status.",
