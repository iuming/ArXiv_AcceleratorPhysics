  "title": "Vacuum in Accelerators for Mechanical & Materials Engineering",
  "abstract": "Vacuum systems are an intrinsic part of any accelerator around the world: all particles circulate under vacuum. This lecture gives rudiments on the fundamentals of vacuum science such as units, ideal gas law, partial pressure, mean free path, flow of molecules, conductance, pumping speed, and outgassing. An overview of standard vacuum instruments for pressure measurement and pumping is presented. Finally, the specificities of accelerator vacuum systems are introduced, discussing some design, construction, installation, and commissioning aspects, as well as fundamentals of beam-vacuum interactions with synchrotron radiation and electron cloud.",
