  "title": "In situ and operando laboratory X-ray absorption spectroscopy at high temperature and controlled gas atmosphere with a plug-flow fixed-bed cell",
  "abstract": "The capabilities of a plug-flow fixed-bed cell for operando studies of heterogeneous catalysts are demonstrated using laboratory-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with a von Hamos spectrometer. The cell operates at temperatures up to 1000 deg C and pressures up to 10 bar, equipped with three mass flow controllers and two infrared lamps for rapid heating under inert/reactive gas atmospheres. Proof-of-principle studies include in situ MnO oxidation in 5% Ni/MnO and operando Ni nanoparticle evolution in 20-NiO/COK-12 (20.2% NiO on SiO2) during CO2 methanation before/after activation. Within 5-15 min per spectrum, oxidation state changes are resolved while catalytic activity is simultaneously quantified by online GC. Extended datasets and methods are available in the ancillary file SI.pdf (Supplementary Information file). A shortened version is submitted to Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry as a Technical Note.",
