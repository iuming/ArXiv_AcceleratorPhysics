  "title": "Rotation catalyzed chiral magnetovortical instability",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate that a background rotation significantly catalyzes the chiral magnetovortical instability in chiral magnetohydrodynamics. The rotation splits the linearly polarized Alfven wave into two circularly polarized magneto-Coriolis waves, one of which exhibits a lower frequency than the original Alfven wave. We find that this low-frequency magneto-Coriolis wave is always unstable in the presence of even a weak chiral vortical effect. This instability may enable new dynamo mechanism applicable to various rotating chiral plasmas.",
