  "title": "GPU-Accelerated Analytic Simulation of Sparse Signals in Pixelated Time Projection Detector",
  "abstract": "This paper presents a GPU-accelerated simulation package,   TRED, for next-generation neutrino detectors with pixelated   charge readout, leveraging community-driven software ecosystems to   ensure sustainability and extensibility. We introduce two generic   contributions: (i) an effective-charge calculation based on Gaussian   quadrature rules for numerical integration, and (ii) a sparse,   block-binned tensor representation that enables efficient FFT-based   computation of induced signals on readout electrodes for sparsely   activated detector volumes. The former captures sub-grid structure   without requiring dense sampling, while the latter achieves low   memory usage and scalable runtime, as demonstrated in benchmark   studies. The underlying data representation is applicable to   large-scale detectors and to other computational problems involving   sparse activity.",
