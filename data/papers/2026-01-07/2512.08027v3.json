  "title": "Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant",
  "abstract": "Thea Energy, Inc. has developed the preconceptual design for \"Helios,\" a fusion power plant based on the planar coil stellarator architecture. In this overview paper, the design is summarized and the reader is referred to the other papers for more detail. The Helios design is based around a two-field-period quasi-axisymmetric (\"QA\") stellarator equilibrium with aspect ratio 4.5 and a novel tokamak-like X-point divertor. The natural stability, low recirculating power, and steady-state capability of the stellarator are leveraged. Stability and transport are calculated using state-of-the-art, high-fidelity codes and grounded in measured performance of existing experiments. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting (\"HTS\") and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. All coils are planar and convex. A maximum of 20 T on-coil is enforced, a value which has been achieved in existing large-bore HTS coils. There is a minimum of 1.2 m between plasma and coils, leaving space for tritium breeding blanket and neutron shielding. Because of this thick shielding, all coils have a minimum 40-year operational lifetime, the same minimum lifetime of the power plant system. 1.1 GW of thermal power and 390 MW of net electric power are produced. The shaping coils are individually controllable, enabling a uniquely configurable magnetic field for relaxed manufacturing and assembly tolerances and plasma control. A practical maintenance architecture is a primary driver of the design; maintenance is performed on entire toroidal sectors that are removed from between the encircling coils. A biennial maintenance cycle is estimated to take approximately 84 days, resulting in an 88% capacity factor. Rigorous engineering constraints such as temperature and stress limits are enforced.",
