  "title": "Effect of Synchrotron Radiation on Staged Plasma Wakefield Accelerators",
  "abstract": "In a staged, beam-driven, plasma wakefield accelerator, electrons are accelerated in a sequence of plasma stages, each powered by a driver electron bunch. Between each stage, a magnetic chicane is used to dispose of the spent driver and to inject the new fresh one, while transporting the witness bunch. We discuss the effect of synchrotron radiation in the interstage section on the accelerating gradient and on the final energy reach of such a machine.",
