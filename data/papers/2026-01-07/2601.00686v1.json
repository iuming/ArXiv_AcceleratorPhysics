  "title": "Stimulation of surface ionization waves by pulsed laser irradiation",
  "abstract": "The inclusion of semiconducting material within a composite barrier enables the perfectly uniform propagation of surface ionization waves (SIW) in air at atmospheric pressure regardless of the polarity of the applied electric field, unlike surface discharges generated using purely dielectric barriers. We exploit the photonic properties of silicon to stimulate the SIW using external irradiation by a 2-ns pulsed laser at 532 nm, with a fluence of 1.3 mJ/cm$^2$ per pulse at the surface. No effect is observed when irradiation occurs more than 3 $μ$s before plasma generation. This timescale is attributed to the ambipolar diffusion of photoexcited carriers away from the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. When this delay shortens to less than 3 $μ$s, the SIW propagates farther and with more intense optical emission. Furthermore, the energy of the discharge increases by up to 7%. The sensitivity to the laser-plasma delay demonstrates that the observed stimulation of the SIW cannot be due to the desorption of surface charge by irradiation.",
