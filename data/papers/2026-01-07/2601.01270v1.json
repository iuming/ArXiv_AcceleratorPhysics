  "title": "Plasma-Activated Water (PAW) for the Degradation of Organic Pollutants in Diluted Industrial Effluents",
  "abstract": "Plasma activated water (PAW) offers a sustainable, nonthermal solution for degrading persistent organic pollutants in industrial effluents. This study employed a gliding arc plasma system to generate PAW for treating diluted waste water containing dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. Experimental parameters such as exposure time, dilution ratio, and pollutant concentration were varied, with analysis conducted using UV Vis spectroscopy, HPLC, TOC, and COD. Results showed high degradation efficiencies, up to 90% for dyes, 85% for pesticides, and 80% for pharmaceuticals following pseudo first order kinetics driven by hydroxyl and nitrate or nitrite radicals. The findings demonstrate PAWs potential as a green, scalable wastewater treatment strategy that minimizes chemical use, supports water reuse, and enhances environmental safety, with future scope for pilot scale applications.",
