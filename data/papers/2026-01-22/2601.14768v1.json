  "title": "Efficient and precise Cherenkov-based charged particle timing using SiPMs",
  "abstract": "Dedicated R&D efforts are currently underway to couple a thin Cherenkov radiator to Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays for precise charged particle Time-of-Flight (ToF) measurements. The prompt nature of Cherenkov radiation makes it an ideal candidate for achieving ultimate timing performance in a ToF detector. Using a thin radiator with a high refractive index, such as fused silica, enables the generation of a fast signal from charged particles that exceed the Cherenkov threshold. A crucial requirement for approaching the target time resolution is the optimization of both the radiator material and thickness, as well as the optical coupling to the SiPM arrays. In this work, we present the main factors that affect the time resolution and the expected performance achieved through a detailed Monte Carlo simulation and the comparison with beam test results.",
