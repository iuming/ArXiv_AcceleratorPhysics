  "title": "Innovations in High- and Ultra-precision Machining",
  "abstract": "Modern precision manufacturing faces the challenge of integrating accuracy requirements into a framework of agile and sustainable production technologies. This development leads to numerous further challenges, affecting almost all areas of precision manufacturing industry. To overcome those challenges, this article presents promising technologies and innovative solution concepts from the field of temperature measurement in the cutting zone, process design for advanced materials, the development of reconfigurable machine tools, the optimization of the temperature behaviour of high-speed spindles and the use of edge computing in machine tools. Using the presented solutions, modern precision machining can be made more future-oriented in terms of sustainability and resilience.",
