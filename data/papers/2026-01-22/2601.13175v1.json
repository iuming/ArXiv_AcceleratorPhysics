  "title": "Electromagnetic ghosts in pair plasmas",
  "abstract": "Collisions of two weakly nonlinear, $a_0 \\ll 1$, counter-propagating EM pulses in pair plasma leave behind a long-surviving collection of localized waves, {\\it an electromagnetic ghost}. Waves are trapped (localized) by the random large density fluctuations created by the beat between the pulses. The process is similar to random plasma density grating and/or Anderson-like wave localization. Structures survive for long, mesoscale times, while the EM energy slowly bleeds through high density walls of the density trap. Large guide magnetic field, $ω_B \\geq $ few $ω$, suppresses the formation of the ghosts.",
