  "title": "AAFIYA: Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment",
  "abstract": "This paper presents AAFIYA (Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment), a modular Python toolkit for automated characterization of radio-frequency antennas using measurement and simulation data. The toolkit provides a unified workflow for processing S-parameters, impedance, realized gain, beam patterns, polarization metrics, and calibration-based yield estimation, with support for standard Touchstone files and beam pattern data. AAFIYA is validated using measurements from an electromagnetic anechoic chamber involving Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) reference antennas and Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Bottom Vertically Polarized antennas over 100-850 MHz. Extracted metrics, including impedance matching, realized gain patterns, vector effective lengths, and cross-polarization ratio, are compared against full-wave simulations from HFSS and WIPL-D, showing good agreement across frequency and angle. The results demonstrate that AAFIYA enables accurate, reproducible, and publication-ready antenna analysis, and provides a flexible foundation for future extensions, including automated optimization and data-driven antenna design.",
