  "title": "The Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and its Application to Nonlinear Beam Dynamics: Comparison of Approaches",
  "abstract": "The rarely used Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been utilized as an elegant way to find the trajectories of mechanical systems and to derive symplectic maps. Further, the exact solution in kick approximation of Hamilton's equations of motion in interaction representation is written as a generalized one-turn twist map.   One can imagine that the nonlinear kick comes first, followed by the one-period rotation along the machine circumference, or a second alternative in which the one-period rotation occurs before the kick. There is a difference in the result of solving Hamilton's equations between the two cases, which is expressed in obtaining a standard forward twist map in the first case, or alternatively a backward map in the second one. This nontrivial and intuitively unclear peculiarity is usually ignored/overlooked in practically all specialized references on the topic.   Finally, the statistical properties and the behavior of the density distribution of a particle beam in configuration space under the influence of an isolated sextupole have been studied.",
