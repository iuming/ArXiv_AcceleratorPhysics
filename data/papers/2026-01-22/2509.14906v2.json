  "title": "Multi-color XFEL pulses with variable color separation and time delay for multi-frame diffraction imaging",
  "abstract": "X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) of high brightness have opened new opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamical processes in matter, enabling imaging and movies of single molecules and particles at atomic resolution. In this paper, we present a straightforward method for multi-frame diffraction imaging, using the same electron beam to generate four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The optical klystron scheme is introduced to enhance FEL intensity and reduce the total length of undulators. The time delay is tuned via a magnetic chicane between the undulators with various colors. Using parameters of SHINE, start-to-end simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and tunability of our method, achieving representative results such as time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL pulses spanning 1.8 to 2.7 nm with 0.3 nm intervals. The proposed scheme enables the recording of multi-frame diffraction images in a single exposure, providing a new perspective for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies.",
