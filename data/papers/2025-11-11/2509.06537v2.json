  "title": "3D-printed components for electron-ion trapping: Tests of functionality   and ultra-high vacuum compatibility",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at room temperature.",
