  "title": "TCT-based monitoring of LGAD radiation hardness for ATLAS-HGTD   production",
  "abstract": "Production of the High Granularity Timing Detector for the ATLAS experiment at High Luminosity LHC requires over 21000 silicon sensors based on Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) technology. Their radiation hardness is monitored as a part of the production quality control. Dedicated test structures from each wafer are irradiated with neutrons and a fast and comprehensive characterization is required. We introduce a new test method based on Transient Current Technique (TCT) performed in the interface region of two LGAD devices. The measurement enables extraction of numerous sensor performance parameters, such as LGAD gain layer depletion voltage, LGAD gain dependence on bias voltage, sensor leakage current and effective interpad distance. Complementary capacitance-voltage measurements and charge collection measurements with 90Sr on the same samples have been performed to calibrate the TCT results in terms of charge collection and define acceptance criteria for wafer radiation hardness in the ATLAS-HGTD project.",
