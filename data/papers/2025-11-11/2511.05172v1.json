  "title": "Design and performance of a xenon-based cryogenic heat pump demonstrator   for future LXe observatories",
  "abstract": "This manuscript details the development and characterization of a small-scale cryogenic heat pump demonstrator, a technology designed to enable high-flow xenon distillation systems for the removal of $^{222}\\mathrm{Rn}$ in future liquid xenon observatories like the XLZD experiment. The heat pump demonstrator operates on a left-turning Clausius-Rankine cycle, utilizing xenon as phase-changing working medium. Two demonstration tests conducted at a nominal pressure of $3.3\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ and $4.3\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ showed stable operation through out the test. In both measurements the demonstrator achieved its designed cooling and heating power of $(124\\pm8)\\,\\mathrm{Watt}$ and $(126\\pm8)\\,\\mathrm{Watt}$ respectively, while consuming $(386\\pm1)\\,\\mathrm{Watt}$ electrical power.",
