  "title": "Strain-engineered nanoscale spin polarization reversal in diamond   nitrogen-vacancy centers",
  "abstract": "The ability to control solid-state quantum emitters is fundamental to advancing quantum technologies. The performance of these systems is fundamentally governed by their spin-dependent photodynamics, yet conventional control methods using cavities offer limited access to key non-radiative processes. Here we demonstrate that anisotropic lattice strain serves as a powerful tool for manipulating spin dynamics in solid-state systems. Under high pressure, giant shear strain gradients trigger a complete reversal of the intrinsic spin polarization, redirecting ground-state population from $|0\\rangle$ to $|\\pm 1\\rangle$ manifold. We show that this reprogramming arises from strain-induced mixing of the NV center's excited states and dramatic alteration of intersystem crossing, which we quantify through a combination of opto-magnetic spectroscopy and a theoretical model that disentangles symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking strain contributions. Furthermore, the polarization reversal is spatially mapped with a transition region below 120 nm, illustrating sub-diffraction-limit control. Our work establishes strain engineering as a powerful tool for tailoring quantum emitter properties, opening avenues for programmable quantum light sources, high-density spin-based memory, and hybrid quantum photonic devices.",
