  "title": "Quantum Ornstein-Zernike Theory for Two-Temperature Two-Component   Plasmas",
  "abstract": "Laboratory plasma production almost always preferentially heats either the ions or electrons, leading to a two-temperature state. High-fidelity modeling of these systems can be achieved with density functional theory molecular dynamics in the two-temperature, adiabatic electron limit. Motivated by this, we construct a statistical mechanics framework for the multi-temperature system that is theoretically consistent with the ab initio calculation. We proceed to derive multi-temperature quantum Ornstein-Zernike equations for the first time. We then construct a two-temperature two-component plasma model using the average atom and compute the radial distribution function, viscosity, ion thermal conductivity, and ion self-diffusion. We verify that we recover the ionic structure and self-diffusion of density functional molecular dynamics simulations.",
