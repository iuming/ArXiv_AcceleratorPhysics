  "title": "Low-impedance stripline kicker for the transverse instability   suppression system of the synchrotron radiation facility \"SKIF\" light source",
  "abstract": "Construction of the new fourth generation synchrotron radiation facility (SRF) \"SKIF\" near Novosibirsk is nearing completion. \"SKIF\" uniqueness is ultra-low 75 pm natural emittance at 400 mA beam current and 3 GeV beam energy.   Collective effects (beam interaction with the vacuum chamber) are the main obstacles of achieving such emittance and beam current. To suppress these effects the storage ring will be equipped with a bunch-by-bunch feedback system. Important components of the feedback system are a stripline (fast) kicker and a beam position monitor.   The paper describes design of the low-impedance stripline kicker for SRF \"SKIF\" storage ring, optimized for the manufacturing and for the uniformity of the imparted transverse kick. The kicker qualities such as S-parameters, imparted transverse momentum, transfer and beam impedances are presented. The chosen length of the stripline kicker allows its use as a beam position monitor.",
