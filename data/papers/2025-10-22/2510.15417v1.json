  "title": "Landau Damping",
  "abstract": "Landau damping is a key mechanism to preserve the stability of particle beams under the influence of various collective forces that would otherwise spoil its quality through beam instabilities. We describe its root cause as well as ways to control it in order to design and operate particle accelerators.",
