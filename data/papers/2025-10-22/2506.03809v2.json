  "title": "Low frequency phase stabilization and phase tuning of an optical lattice   with a variable period",
  "abstract": "Optical lattices play a significant role in the field of cold atom physics, particularly in quantum simulations. Varying the lattice period is often a useful feature, but it presents the challenge of maintaining lattice phase stability in both stationary and varying-period regimes. Here, we report the realization of a low frequency feedback loop for a tunable optical lattice. Our scheme employs a CCD camera, a computer, and a piezoelectric actuator mounted on a mirror. Using this setup, we significantly improved the long-term stability of an optical lattice over durations exceeding 10 seconds. More importantly, we demonstrated a rapid change in the optical lattice period without any loss of phase. The developed phase stabilization algorithm can be extended to more complicated 2D latices, than just periodic lattice.",
