  "title": "Hamiltonian estimation of island width threshold for stochasticity onset   on edge pedestal top in presence of a resonant magnetic perturbation",
  "abstract": "This study applies the Hamiltonian method to analyze the nonlinear magnetic topology induced by Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) in tokamaks. We investigate the system's chaotic behavior by comparing three methods: the renormalization method, Lyapunov exponents (LE), and weighted Birkhoff average (WBA). A strong consistency is found among these methods in predicting the large scale stochasticity threshold. The magnetic island width threshold provides a quantitative criterion for optimizing RMP-based ELM control, bridging a critical gap in plasma control strategies.",
