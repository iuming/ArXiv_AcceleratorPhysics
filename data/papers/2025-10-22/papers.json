    "title": "Geometric scaling of laser-driven proton focusing from hemispherical   foils",
    "abstract": "We systematically characterize the focusing behavior of laser-driven proton beams from hemispherical targets of various diameters using mesh radiography. The proton focal location is inferred to be near the geometrical center for the smallest tested hemisphere ($\\Psi=D_{hemi}/D_{Laser}=6.1$). However, larger hemispheres ($\\Psi=14.6$) degrade the focusing behavior and behave more like flat foils with focal location significantly inside the hemisphere. We also infer a tight virtual focus of $9\\pm3~\\mu$m through a mesh transition analysis.",

    "title": "Compensating for Amplifier Non-Linearity in a SEL Controller",
    "abstract": "The Self-Excited Loop (SEL) architecture, used in some continuous-wave (CW) superconducting linacs, relies on a positive feedback mechanism that requires carefully defined operating limits to ensure stable operation. These limits are typically derived from amplifier calibration, which characterizes the relationship between forward power and DAC drive. However, amplifier non-linearity often prevents a simple linear fit of this characteristic, introducing errors that can compromise stability. To address this, we present a modified calibration procedure that incorporates amplifier non-linearity into the SEL framework. The approach is validated with test data from a 32 kW solid-state amplifier (SSA) and a cavity emulator developed for the Fermilab PIP-II linac.",

    "title": "Real-Time Readout System Design for the BULLKID-DM Experiment: Enhancing   Dark Matter Search Capabilities",
    "abstract": "The BULLKID-DM experiment aims to detect WIMP-like potential Dark Matter particles with masses below 1 GeV/c^2. Sensing these particles is challenging, as it requires nuclear recoil detectors characterized by high exposure and an energy threshold in the order of 100 eV, thus exceeding the capabilities of conventional semiconductor detectors. BULLKID-DM intends to tackle this challenge by using cryogenic Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) with exceptional energy thresholds to sense a target with a total mass of 800 g across 16 wafers, divided into over 2000 individually instrumented silicon dice. The MKIDs on each wafer are coupled to a single transmission line and read using a frequency division multiplexing approach by the room-temperature data acquisition.   In this contribution, we describe and assess the design of the room-temperature readout electronics system, including the selected hardware components and the FPGA firmware which contains the real-time signal processing stages for tone generation, frequency demultiplexing, and event triggering. We evaluate the system on the ZCU216 board, a commercial evaluation card built around a Radio-Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) with integrated high-speed DACs and ADCs, and connected it to a custom-designed analog front-end for signal conditioning.",

    "title": "Plasma Shape Control via Zero-shot Generative Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Traditional PID controllers have limited adaptability for plasma shape control, and task-specific reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from limited generalization and the need for repetitive retraining. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for developing a versatile, zero-shot control policy from a large-scale offline dataset of historical PID-controlled discharges. Our approach synergistically combines Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Hilbert space representation learning to achieve dual objectives: mimicking the stable operational style of the PID data and constructing a geometrically structured latent space for efficient, goal-directed control. The resulting foundation policy can be deployed for diverse trajectory tracking tasks in a zero-shot manner without any task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations on the HL-3 tokamak simulator demonstrate that the policy excels at precisely and stably tracking reference trajectories for key shape parameters across a range of plasma scenarios. This work presents a viable pathway toward developing highly flexible and data-efficient intelligent control systems for future fusion reactors.",

    "title": "Tilt-to-length noise subtraction with pointing jitters from closed-loop   dynamics for TianQin",
    "abstract": "TianQin is a proposed space-based mission for gravitational wave detection, employing a constellation of three drag-free satellites in high Earth orbits to form a laser interferometric observatory. A critical technical challenge is mitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the third dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise is unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites, movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be subtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients can be estimated from the null TDI channel $\\zeta$ and used for noise subtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA yaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of realistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC) are yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations to generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration capability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more favorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the accuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency data (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve estimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such as $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case of high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different sinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These methods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the TTL noise subtraction.",

    "abstract": "Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\\gamma} \\gtrsim 3\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.",

    "abstract": "ALICE 3 is the proposed next-generation heavy-ion experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), envisioned for operation during Run 5. The tracking system of ALICE 3 will consist of a high-precision vertex detector integrated into a retractable structure inside the beam pipe, complemented by a large-area outer tracker covering a broad pseudorapidity range. Both systems will be based on the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) technology, building upon the developments realized for the recently upgraded ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS2) and the future ITS3 upgrade. The total silicon area of the ALICE 3 tracking system is expected to be approximately five times larger than that of ITS2, presenting significant challenges in terms of large-scale sensor testing and module production. To address these challenges, research and development activities have been initiated in Korea, including the adaptation of an automated die-attach machine, commonly used in the semiconductor packaging industry, for efficient sensor-to-substrate assembly. This contribution presents the ongoing efforts of the Korea ALICE group toward the development and production of the ALICE 3 silicon tracker.

    "abstract": "BULLKID is a cryogenic, solid-state detector designed for direct searches of particle Dark Matter candidates, with mass $\\lesssim 1$ GeV/c$^2$, and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. It is based on an array of dice carved in 5 mm thick silicon crystal, sensed by phonon-mediated Kinetic Inductance Detectors. In previous works, the array was calibrated with bursts of optical photons, which are absorbed in the first hundreds nanometers of the dice and give rise to surface events. In this work, we present the reconstruction of bulk events through the 59.5 keV $\\gamma$-ray generated by an $^{241}$Am source, which emulates more closely the interaction of Dark Matter and neutrinos. The peak resolution is $5\\%~(\\sigma)$ and its position is shifted by less than $10\\%$ with respect to the optical calibration. We observe that the resolution is further improved by a factor $2$ combining the signal from neighboring dice. These results confirm the performance of the detector in view of the physics goals of the BULLKID-DM experiment for dark matter search.",

    "abstract": "The transition toward renewable, fiber-based packaging requires an improved understanding of chemical modifications in high-yield pulps such as chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the energy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory methods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the fiber level, which can be visualized using $\\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present a laboratory $\\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its capability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets. A 32 $\\times$ 32 point grid scan (1.6-1.6 mm$^2$ field of view, 50 $\\mu$m step, 300 s/point) successfully resolved sulfur K$\\alpha$ (2.31 keV) and calcium K$\\alpha$ (3.69 keV) fluorescence without helium flushing. Comparative measurements at the Elettra synchrotron confirmed consistency of sulfur peak position and spatial distribution, with higher spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Histogram analysis using Wasserstein distance metrics demonstrated close agreement between datasets despite differing acquisition conditions. These results demonstrate that laboratory XRF can reproducibly detect and map sulfur in CTMP fibers under ambient conditions, providing a practical tool to complement synchrotron studies and supporting the development of energy-efficient, fiber-based packaging materials.",

    "abstract": "The HL-LHC will challenge the detectors with a nearly 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity compared to the previous LHC runs combined, thus the CMS detector will be upgraded to face the higher levels of radiation and the larger amounts of collision data to be collected. The High-Granularity Calorimeter will replace the current endcap calorimeters of the CMS detector. It will facilitate the use of particle-flow calorimetry with its unprecedented transverse and longitudinal readout/trigger segmentation, with more than 6M readout channels. The electromagnetic section as well as the high-radiation regions of the hadronic section of the HGCAL (fluences above $10^{14}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$) will be equipped with silicon pad sensors, covering a total area of 620 m$^2$. Fluences up to $10^{16}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$ and doses up to 1.5 MGy are expected. The sensors are processed on novel 8\" p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300 $\\mu{}m$, 200 $\\mu{}m$ and 120 $\\mu{}m$ and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the wafer area and tiling. Each sensor contains several hundred individually read out cells of two sizes (around 0.6 cm$^2$ or 1.2 cm$^2$). To investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, the sensors have been irradiated with neutrons at RINSC to fluences between $6.5 \\times 10^{14}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$ and $1.4 \\times 10^{16}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$. Electrical characterization results are presented for full sensors, as well as for partial sensors cut from multi-geometry wafers with internal dicing lines on the HV potential within the active sensor area. Leakage current behaviour is investigated for various sensor types and fluence levels, including its temperature dependence. Finally, methods to limit the annealing time of the sensors during irradiation are investigated by analysing the impact of splitting high-fluence irradiations.",

Here, we report the realization of a low frequency feedback loop for a tunable optical lattice. Our scheme employs a CCD camera, a computer, and a piezoelectric actuator mounted on a mirror. Using this setup, we significantly improved the long-term stability of an optical lattice over durations exceeding 10 seconds. More importantly, we demonstrated a rapid change in the optical lattice period without any loss of phase. The developed phase stabilization algorithm can be extended to more complicated 2D latices, than just periodic lattice.",

    "abstract": "Construction of the new fourth generation synchrotron radiation facility (SRF) \"SKIF\" near Novosibirsk is nearing completion. \"SKIF\" uniqueness is ultra-low 75 pm natural emittance at 400 mA beam current and 3 GeV beam energy.   Collective effects (beam interaction with the vacuum chamber) are the main obstacles of achieving such emittance and beam current. To suppress these effects the storage ring will be equipped with a bunch-by-bunch feedback system. Important components of the feedback system are a stripline (fast) kicker and a beam position monitor.   The paper describes design of the low-impedance stripline kicker for SRF \"SKIF\" storage ring, optimized for the manufacturing and for the uniformity of the imparted transverse kick. The kicker qualities such as S-parameters, imparted transverse momentum, transfer and beam impedances are presented. The chosen length of the stripline kicker allows its use as a beam position monitor.",

    "abstract": "The N$\\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy resolution through direct charge collection.   In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\\nu$DEx ion TPC. The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding values of $0.444 \\pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \\pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively.   The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an 10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on drift time differences and Breadth First search.   To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and sensitivity studies in the N$\\nu$DEx experiment.",

    "title": "Measurement of radon concentration in the output water of the 100~t/h   ultrapure water system at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory",
    "abstract": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purpose low background liquid scintillator detector, was proposed primarily to determine the neutrino mass ordering. To mitigate radioactivity from surrounding rock and enable cosmic muon tagging, its central detector is immersed in a Water Cherenkov Detector (WCD) containing 40~ktons of ultrapure water instrumented with 2400 20-inch micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes. Stringent radiopurity requirements mandate a radon concentration below 10 ~mBq/m$^3$ in the WCD. To achieve this, we developed a two-stage (ground and underground) ultrapure water system with 100~t/h production capacity, integrating a five-stage degassing membrane for radon removal. A novel microbubble technique was implemented to optimize the degassing membranes' radon removal efficiency. The synergistic combination of the microbubble technology and the multistage degassing membranes achieved a radon removal efficiency exceeding 99.9\\%, reducing the system's output to 0.61 $\\pm$ 0.50~mBq/m$^3$ in recirculation mode, surpassing design specifications and establishing world-leading performance standards. This paper details the ultrapure system architecture, quantifies the radon contributions of each device, and presents a comprehensive study on microbubble-augmented membrane degassing for low radon ultra-pure water production in a 100~t/h water system.",

    "title": "Probing Flying-Focus Wakefields",
    "abstract": "Flying-focus wakefields, which can propagate with a tunable velocity along the optical axis, are promising solutions to electron dephasing in laser-wakefield accelerators. This is accomplished by a combination of spatio-temporal couplings and focusing with an axiparabola, a specialized optical element which produces a quasi-Bessel beam. If implemented, dephasingless acceleration would allow for a hitherto unachievable mixture of high acceleration gradients and long acceleration lengths. Here, we conduct an in-depth study of the structure and behavior of such a flying-focus wakefield, through a combination of direct imaging and simulations. We show the stability of the wakefield structures, explore how the wakefield evolves with changes of density, study the effects of ionization on the wakefield structure with a variety of gases, and analyze the importance of the focusing position. These insights shed light onto this novel wakefield regime and bring understanding that is important to the realization of dephasingless acceleration.",

    "abstract": "The ionization quenching factor, the fraction of an ion's initial kinetic energy lost through ionization in a medium, was measured for H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions within the 2.5-5 keV energy range in an Ar/CO$_2$ gas mixture at pressures between 75 and 150 mbar. The mixture was contained in the active volume of a MICROMEGAS type Micro Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD), which was connected to an ion source via a high vacuum system. The results showed a significant decrease in ionization as the ion energy decreased, although no dependence on gas pressure was observed within the low pressure range studied. Additionally, significant deviations from the predictions of SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) simulations were found. These measurements also allowed the first determination of $W$ values (the average energy required to create an electron-ion pair in the gas) for H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions in Ar at this particular energy range, which had not been previously explored for these projectile-target combinations. These findings are essential for accurate ion energy reconstruction in low-pressure MPGDs, with particular relevance for space-based energetic neutral atom detection, as proposed by the Italian Space Agency's SWEATERS project.",

    "abstract": "We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.3 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.6 to 1.5 ns in the single-photon regime with an intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, and also in pixel count and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and timewalk effect, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera's temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.",

    "abstract": "The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a nextgeneration ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope, will require detector technologies capable of supporting substantially larger pixel-count arrays than those flown on previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) provide a scalable solution through microwave multiplexing and have already been demonstrated in balloon-borne instruments using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for real-time signal processing. A central element of MKID readout is the Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB) spectrometer, which converts digitized timedomain signals into finely resolved frequency channels for subsequent analysis. To meet the demands for broader bandwidths and higher spectral resolution driven by emerging science goals, efficient FPGA-based implementations of the PFB are essential. This work presents current results from a fixed-point digital design methodology for deploying the PFB architecture on spacequalified FPGAs. The approach emphasizes efficient resource utilization and numerical precision while satisfying stringent performance constraints, enabling scalable, high-resolution spectral processing for future space observatories and remote sensing applications.",

The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations.

    "abstract": "We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\\ell/\\hbar=0,\\pm1,\\pm2,\\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\\rm kin}\\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\\rm kin}\\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u.

    "abstract": "In the study of plasma, particularly in applications involving strong laser-plasma interactions, the propagation of a strong electromagnetic wave induces relativistic velocities in the electron flow. Given such conditions, the wave propagating through the plasma experiences modulational instability. In this paper, we investigate this instability using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. In the relativistic limit, the motion of ions can be neglected due to their significant inertia, allowing us to treat the ions as a background fluid. This simplification enables us to apply perturbation techniques to the electron fluid equations, leading to the derivation of the nonlinear wave equation in the form of the Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Equation (NLSE). We also explore the relationship between wave dispersion and the conditions for instability. We derive the maximum growth rate of the modulational instability and analyze its dependence on plasma parameters and wave intensity in the context of relativistic magnetized plasma, providing quantitative insights into the instability dynamics. Finally, we examine aspects of the perturbed NLSE using the Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky perturbation approach, treating real and imaginary coefficients separately, which explicitly incorporates both Nonlinear Landau Damping (NLLD) and growth-damping effects.",

    "title": "A flexible and differentiable coil proxy for stellarator equilibrium   optimization",
    "abstract": "Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most present stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: the first for the equilibrium and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. It is challenging to find a compromise between plasma and coils with this approach. In recent years, single-stage approaches have gained popularity, which attempt to optimize both the plasma and coils simultaneously to improve the plasma-coil balance. In exchange, it can substantially increase the problem's dimensionality and introduce the ill-posedness of filamentary coil optimization to equilibrium optimization. This paper introduces a new ``quasi-single-stage'' method representing a flexible and differentiable coil proxy that directly predicts coil complexity during equilibrium optimization. The proxy is based on the adjoint differentiation of a winding surface coil subproblem. Our proxy can balance coil and plasma performance without introducing new degrees of freedom or ill-posedness.

    "title": "Discontinuous Galerkin Representation of the Maxwell-Jüttner   Distribution",
    "abstract": "Kinetic simulations of relativistic gases and plasmas are critical for understanding diverse astrophysical and terrestrial systems, but the accurate construction of the relativistic Maxwellian, the Maxwell-J\\\"uttner (MJ) distribution, on a discrete simulation grid is challenging. Difficulties arise from the finite velocity bounds of the domain, which may not capture the entire distribution function, as well as errors introduced by projecting the function onto a discrete grid. Here we present a novel scheme for iteratively correcting the moments of the projected distribution applicable to all grid-based discretizations of the relativistic kinetic equation. In addition, we describe how to compute the needed nonlinear quantities, such as Lorentz boost factors, in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme through a combination of numerical quadrature and weak operations. The resulting method accurately captures the distribution function and ensures that the moments match the desired values to machine precision.",

    "title": "Demonstration of a 1820 channel multiplexer for transition-edge sensor   bolometers",
    "abstract": "The scalability of most transition-edge sensor arrays is limited by the multiplexing technology which combines their signals over a reduced number of wires and amplifiers. In this Letter, we present and demonstrate a multiplexer design optimized for transition-edge sensor bolometers with 1820 sensors per readout unit, a factor of two more than the previous state-of-the-art. The design is optimized for cosmic microwave background imaging applications, and it builds on previous microwave superconducting quantum interference device multiplexers by doubling the available readout bandwidth to the full 4-8 GHz octave. Evaluating the key performance metrics of yield, sensitivity, and crosstalk through laboratory testing, we find an end-to-end operable detector yield of 78%, a typical nearest-neighbor crosstalk amplitude of ~0.4%, and a median white noise level of 83 pA/rtHz due to the multiplexer, corresponding to an estimated contribution of 4% to the total system noise for a ground-based cosmic microwave background telescope. Additionally, we identify a possible path toward reducing resonator loss for future designs with reduced noise. We expect these developments to alleviate the system complexity, cryogenic requirements, and cost of future large arrays of low temperature detectors.",

    "title": "Physics insights from a large-scale 2D UEDGE simulation database for   detachment control in KSTAR",
    "abstract": "A large-scale database of two-dimensional UEDGE simulations has been developed to study detachment physics in KSTAR and to support surrogate models for control applications. Nearly 70,000 steady-state solutions were generated, systematically scanning upstream density, input power, plasma current, impurity fraction, and anomalous transport coefficients, with magnetic and electric drifts across the magnetic field included. The database identifies robust detachment indicators, with strike-point electron temperature at detachment onset consistently Te around 3-4 eV, largely insensitive to upstream conditions. Scaling relations reveal weaker impurity sensitivity than one-dimensional models and show that heat flux widths follow Eich's scaling only for uniform, low D and Chi. Distinctive in-out divertor asymmetries are observed in KSTAR, differing qualitatively from DIII-D. Complementary time-dependent simulations quantify plasma response to gas puffing, with delays of 5-15 ms at the outer strike point and approximately 40 ms for the low-magnetic-field-side (LFS) radiation front. These dynamics are well captured by first-order-plus-dead-time (FOPDT) models and are consistent with experimentally observed detachment-control behavior in KSTAR [Gupta et al., submitted to Plasma Phys.

The radio frequency that creates the optical sidebands for CPT quickly switches between two magnetic sensitive transitions and the magnetic field is extrapolated from the difference of the center frequencies of the magnetic resonances. Light shifts and common drifts like collisional shifts can be suppressed through careful choice of measured resonances and we show the light shift reduction by more than a factor of 20 compared to excitation with circular polarized light. Various limitations to the method are discussed.",

While transmission methods are well established, backscattering approaches remain less explored from a metrological perspective, often lacking a systematic treatment of uncertainties.

Applying the method to helium ions in gold thin films, we identify angular conditions that balance precision and accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3\\% over a wide energy range. The results, benchmarked against SRIM and ICRU-49, demonstrate that our approach improves the reliability of RBS-derived stopping data and strengthens their use for reference purposes and model validation.",

    "abstract": "In wave propagation problems, finite difference methods implemented on staggered grids are commonly used to avoid checkerboard patterns and to improve accuracy in the approximation of short-wavelength components of the solutions. In this study, we develop a mimetic finite difference (MFD) method on staggered grids for transport operators with divergence-free advective field that is proven to be energy-preserving in wave problems. This method mimics some characteristics of the summation-by-parts (SBP) operators framework, in particular it preserves the divergence theorem at the discrete level. Its design is intended to be versatile and applicable to wave problems characterized by a divergence-free velocity. As an application, we consider the electrostatic shear Alfv\\'en waves (SAWs), appearing in the modeling of plasmas. These waves are solved in a magnetic field configuration recalling that of a tokamak device. The study of the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the SAWs shows the energy conservation of the discretization scheme, demonstrating the stability of the numerical solution.",

High-fidelity modeling of these systems can be achieved with density functional theory molecular dynamics in the two-temperature, adiabatic electron limit.

We proceed to derive multi-temperature quantum Ornstein-Zernike equations for the first time. We then construct a two-temperature two-component plasma model using the average atom and compute the radial distribution function, viscosity, ion thermal conductivity, and ion self-diffusion. We verify that we recover the ionic structure and self-diffusion of density functional molecular dynamics simulations.",

    "abstract": "A novel matrix method of analyzing ion saturation current data from a general three-dimensional (3D) array of unmagnetized Mach probe tips is developed and used with data sets from two 3D Mach probes to make initial measurements of local plasma flow velocity in reversed-field pinch (RFP) experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST). The two 3D Mach probes are composed of regular polyhedral arrays of six and four tips, respectively, with the six-tip array composed of three orthogonal pairs of mutually opposite tips at the vertices of a regular octahedron and the four-tip array composed of non-opposite tips at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, the analysis of which is specifically facilitated by the matrix method. Velocity measurement uncertainties for the Mach probes are derived based on uncertainties in probe machining and ion saturation current measurements, and typical relative uncertainties for the probes are estimated to be of order several percent, likely smaller than systematic uncertainties related to the Mach probe calibration constant and experimental uncertainties related to plasma and probe conditioning. Initial results for the octahedral probe show flow speeds of roughly the expected magnitudes based on previous MST measurements but with somes differences in flow direction, while those for the tetrahedron probe show similar flow directions to some previous measurements but also some larger than expected speeds. We consider possible causes for the unexpected results of these initial tests, with a focus on probe conditioning and fast electron issues.",

The structured UHMWPE method was implemented in two distinct components: a vacuum window and a cryogenic infrared filter. This surface structuring approach provides mechanical robustness, cryogenic compatibility, and low insertion loss. We characterize the transmission properties using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS), which demonstrates reflection below $5\\%$ across the full band.

    "abstract": "Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which, however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ with static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures. In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within the framework of DFT for a host of applications.",

After the successful achievement of its first MA-class plasma, the installation of several additional sub-systems, including a set of non-axisymmetric Error Field Correction Coils (EFCC), is ongoing. Optimization of future JT-60SA plasma scenarios will critically depend on the correct use of EFCC, including careful fulfillment of system specifications. In addition to that, preparation and risk mitigation of early ITER operations will greatly benefit from the experience gained by early EFCC application to JT-60SA experiments, in particular to optimize error field detection and control strategies. In this work, EFCC application in JT-60SA Initial Research Phase I perspective scenarios is modeled including plasma response. Impact of (Resonant) Magnetic Perturbations on the different plasma scenarios is assessed for both core and pedestal regions by the linear resistive MHD code MARS-F. The dominant core response to EFs is discussed case by case and compared to mode locking thresholds from literature. Typical current/voltage amplitudes and wave-forms are then compared to EFCC specifications in order to assess a safe operational space.",

    "title": "In-Situ Performance of FBK VUV-HD3 and HPK VUV4 SiPMs in the LoLX Liquid   Xenon Detector",
    "abstract": "Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are a critical technology for the next generation of rare-event search experiments using liquid xenon (LXe). While two VUV-sensitive SiPMs are available, comprehensive in-situ studies are needed to inform detector design and compare device response. This work presents a direct comparison of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) VUV-HD3 and Hamamatsu (HPK) VUV4 SiPMs operated simultaneously within the Light-only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) detector. Using data collected with gamma sources placed outside the detector, we characterized the relative performance of these photosensors. Our analysis reveals that under these operating conditions, the HPK SiPMs are 33-38% less efficient than the FBK devices, a larger difference than predicted by standard PDE models in vacuum measurement. We show that this discrepancy is resolved by our angular and wavelength dependent PDE model incorporating surface shadowing effects into our optical simulation, which then accurately reproduces the experimental data. This finding has significant implications for the selection and implementation of photosensors in future large-scale LXe detectors.",

    "abstract": "Precession of a converged beam during acquisition of a 4D-STEM dataset improves strain, orientation, and phase mapping accuracy by averaging over continuous angles of illumination. Precession experiments usually rely on integrated systems, where automatic alignments lead to fast, high-quality results. The dependence of these experiments on specific hardware and software is evident even when switching to non-integrated detectors on a precession tool, as experimental set-up becomes challenging and time-consuming. Here, we introduce multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a method to perform electron diffraction by collecting sequential 4D-STEM scans at different incident beam tilts. The multiple diffraction datasets are averaged together post-acquisition, resulting in a single dataset that minimizes the impact of the curvature and orientation of the Ewald sphere relative to the crystal under study. Our results demonstrate that even four additional tilts improved measurement of material properties, namely strain and orientation, as compared to single-tilt 4D-STEM experiments. We show the versatility and flexibility of our MAPED approach with data collected on a number of microscopes with different hardware configurations and a variety of detectors.",

The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.",

    "abstract": "Photolithography is a key part of modern semiconductor process flows, and photolithography steppers have been used for decades to achieve precise patterning for device fabrication. However, these tools are often large and expensive, which restricts their use to industry and well-funded university laboratories. In this paper, we propose a $3000 maskless photolithography stepper that is affordable, open-source, and easy to assemble. The stepper, which uses a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector as its optical engine, is able to achieve an optical resolution of under 2 microns. The stepper also features a motorized micropositioning system, which is able to align features with single-digit micron precision. A deep learning computer vision model is also used to achieve fine-grain alignment of patterns on a chip. These capabilities allow for the use of the stepper for microfabrication to produce micron-scale devices such as NMOS transistors.",

    "abstract": "Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.",

    "abstract": "In 1978, Delayen showed how Self-Excited Loops (SEL) can be used to great advantage for controlling narrow-band SRF cavities. Its key capability is establishing closed-loop amplitude control early in the setup process, stabilizing Lorentz forces to allow cavity tuning and phase loop setup in a stable environment. As people around the world implement this basic idea with modern FPGA DSP technology, multiple variations and operational scenarios creep in that have both obvious and non-obvious ramifications for latency, feedback stability, and resiliency. This paper will review the key properties of a Delayen-style SEL when set up for open-loop, amplitude stabilized, and phase-stabilized modes. Then the original analog circuit will be compared and contrasted with the known variations of digital CORDIC-based implementations.",

    "title": "Design optimization of silicon nitride nanomechanical resonators for   thermal infrared detectors: a guide through key figures of merit",
    "abstract": "Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling. Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use cases.",
