  "title": "Testing the DAE LLRF system with a PIP-II SSR2 Cavity",
  "abstract": "The PIP-II linac is an international collaboration project with in kind contributions of key subsystems from multiple countries including India (DAE). In the research and development phase of the project, the LLRF and resonance control systems were jointly developed by BARC and Fermilab and were delivered to Fermilab for testing and validation. Initial testing of the LLRF system was carried out using Fermilabs analog cavity emulator. Following successful emulator testing, the LLRF system was deployed at STC on a PIP-II 325 MHz SSR2 cavity. The cavity was operated in both SEL and GDR modes at a gradient of 5 MV/m. The results of the testing are presented here.",
