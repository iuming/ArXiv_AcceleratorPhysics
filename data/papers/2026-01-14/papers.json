    "title": "Commercial Accelerometers for Vibration Sensing at mK Temperatures in Dry Dilution Refrigerators",
    "abstract": "This article presents an evaluation of off-the-shelf commercial accelerometers at the mixing chamber stage of a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator at temperatures down to 8 mK. In addition, we present results of radioassay of accelerometer samples using a high purity germanium detector counting setup. Cryogen-free dilution refrigerators using pulse-tube cryocoolers (PTs)-due to recent advances in their cooling capacity, long-term stability, and operational costs-have become ubiquitous tools in a wide range of fields ranging from experimental particle physics to quantum information sciences. However, vibrations induced by PTs can negatively impact the experimental payload in these applications. This work demonstrates that commercially available accelerometers can not only measure vibrations at millikelvin cryogenic temperatures but also pave the way for continuous, in situ, real-time vibration monitoring of dry dilution refrigerators.",

    "title": "Search for Cosmic Ray Electron Boosted Dark Matter with the CDEX-10 Experiment",
    "abstract": "We present new constraints on the cosmic ray electron boosted light dark matter (CReDM) using the 205.4 kg$\\cdot$day data of the CDEX-10 experiment located at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The cosmic ray electron spectrum and distribution in the Galaxy are generated by the $\\tt GALPROP$ code package. In the calculation process of DM-electron scattering process in the Galaxy, we consider the energy-dependency of the DM-electron scattering cross section. The constraints on CReDM are set for both heavy and light mediator scenarios using the CDEX-10 dataset. The result exceeds previous Standard Halo Model (SHM) limits for DM mass lower than 0.6 MeV in heavy mediator case and corresponds to the best sensitivity among all direct detection experiments from 1 keV to 0.5 MeV in the light mediator scenario.",

    "title": "Bridging Theory and Experiment in Virtually Imaged Phased Array (VIPA) Spectrometers",
    "abstract": "Virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) spectrometers provide high resolution and fast acquisition in a compact design, but their performance as dispersive instruments is sensitive to fabrication tolerances, component dimensions, and alignment. Here, leveraging numerical simulations validated by experimental data, we present a framework to identify the parameters that limit VIPA spectrometer resolution. This framework is applied to the construction of a new mid infrared VIPA spectrometer, tested at wavelengths near 4.6 um with both continuous-wave and frequency-comb laser sources, with a resolving power predicted by analytical expressions to be as high as RP = 830 000 (corresponding to a resolution of 78 MHz). Validated numerical simulations, however, provided a more realistic estimate that captures limits set by all the optical components. By correcting aberrations and optimizing alignment, a resolving power of RP = 440 000 (150 MHz) was experimentally achieved, corresponding to 80% of the value predicted by numerical simulation of the entire spectrometer. These results bridge the gap between analytical design expressions and experimental results for compact, high-resolution VIPA spectrometers to enable more efficient fabrication and advanced design across critical areas like applied space optics, line-by-line pulse shaping, and broadband spectral sensors.",

    "title": "Observation of narrow-band $γ$ radiation from a boron-doped diamond superlattice with an 855 MeV electron beam",
    "abstract": "We report the first observation of narrow band 1.3 MeV $γ$ radiation from a crystalline micro-undulator. A diamond superlattice was grown with a periodical varying boron doping profile. Four sinusoidally deformed (110) planes resulted with a period length of 5.0 $μ$m and an amplitude of 0.098 nm. A channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI A accelerator facility. A clear peak was detected with a large sodium iodide scintillation detector close to the expected photon energy of 1.28 MeV. Key characteristics of the peak, including photon energy, width and intensity, were reproduced fairly well by Monte-Carlo simulation calculations. Based on the latter, optimized boron doping profiles were designed for the 1.6 GeV beam of MAMI C and a hypothetical 3 GeV beam, enabling preparation of highly directional $γ$-ray beams with photon energies of 4.2 and 14.5 MeV. The predicted spectral bandwidths are, respectively, about 18\\% and 13\\%, however, with a high energy continuum tail. The on-target photon flux at a beam current of 100 $μ$A would be about $10^{12}$/s for the 14.5 MeV photon beam.",

    "title": "Enhanced Athermal Phonon Responsivity in a Kinetic Inductance Detector with Integrated Phonon Collectors",
    "abstract": "Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in light dark matter searches and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments as they can achieve low energy thresholds. The phonon mediated sensing of silicon particle absorbers has already been proved with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), acting both as sensors and athermal phonon absorbers at the same time. In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.",

The ACPS is capable of subcooling supercritical helium supplied via the 1.6-km-long HERA transfer line by means of a pipe heat exchanger immersed in a subcooler bath filled with liquid helium produced through Joule-Thomson valves. It is also equipped with numerous cryogenic components, including control valves, flow meters, and safety valves, enabling experimental operation to be carried out directly by the ACPS itself and thereby reducing the cryogenic requirements imposed on the experiments. To support a wide range of experiments, the ACPS provides three transfer lines that deliver different levels of cooling power.",

    "title": "High-power beyond extreme ultraviolet FEL radiation with flexible polarization at SHINE",
    "abstract": "Linac-based free-electron lasers (FELs) feature high brightness, narrow bandwidth, controllable polarization, and wide wavelength tunability. With the rapid development of superconducting radio-frequency technology, linacs can now operate at MHz-level repetition rates, enabling FELs with both high repetition rates and high average power. Beyond extreme ultraviolet (BEUV) radiation is of great interest for scientific research and industrial applications, especially for next-generation lithography. Owing to the main design parameters of SHINE, the generation of BEUV radiation is a natural capability of the facility. The BEUV characteristics at SHINE are investigated and its achievable performance as a high-average-power light source is evaluated. By applying undulator tapering to enhance the energy extraction efficiency, kilowatt-level BEUV radiation with controllable polarization is shown to be achievable. These results demonstrate that SHINE can provide a high-performance BEUV source, offering a realistic pathway toward a high-average-power light source for next-generation high-resolution lithography.",

    "abstract": "The broad band resonant spin echo interferometer, CANISIUS, is presented. CANISIUS is built in a versatile way, such that it can be operated in both a continuous broad band beam or a pulsed Time of Flight beam. This versatility also extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant Spin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent averaging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.",

    "title": "Efficient calculation of magnetic fields from ferromagnetic materials near strong electromagnets, and application to stellarator coil optimization",
    "abstract": "In fusion reactor design, steels under consideration for the blanket are ferromagnetic, so the steel's effect on the plasma physics must be examined. For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability. Moreover, it is straightforward to differentiate through the model to get the derivative of the field with respect to the electromagnet parameters. We thereby demonstrate gradient-based coil optimization for a quasi-isodynamic stellarator in which the field contribution from a ferromagnetic blanket is included. Even a significant steel volume is found to have little impact on the plasma physics properties, with the main effects being a slight destabilization of ballooning modes and a radial shift of the edge islands due to decrease in rotational transform. Both issues are corrected by minor reoptimization of the coil shapes to account for the field from the steel.",

Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $β= 2μ_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$β$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $β$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.",

    "title": "Noise2Void for Denoising Atomic Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Images",
    "abstract": "The Noise2Void technique is demonstrated for successful denoising of atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. The technique is applied to denoising atomic resolution images and videos of gold adatoms on a graphene surface within a graphene liquid cell, with the denoised experimental data qualitatively demonstrating improved visibility of both the Au adatoms and the graphene lattice. The denoising performance is quantified by comparison to similar simulated data and the approach is found to significantly outperform both total variation and simple Gaussian blurring. Compared to other denoising methods, the Noise2Void technique has the combined advantages that it requires no manual intervention during training or denoising, no prior knowledge of the sample and is compatible with real time data acquisition rates of at least 45 frames per second.",

    "title": "Sub-Pixel Electron Beam Alignment for Machine Learning Characterization of Hybrid Pixel Detectors",
    "abstract": "Due to their radiation hardness, kilohertz frame rates, and high dynamic range, hybrid pixel detectors have recently expanded their application range to electron diffraction and recently also electron imaging. However, these detectors typically have pixel sizes about ten times larger than those of direct electron detectors commonly used for imaging and more prominent electron multiple scattering effects. To overcome these limitations, machine learning approaches can be utilized to reconstruct the electron entrance point and achieve super-resolution. As this process is inherently stochastic, and machine learning relies on suitable training data, high-quality, representative training data are essential for developing models that achieve the best possible resolution. In this work, we present two novel experimental methods for generating such training data. The first method employs precise microscope alignment to scan the detector plane using a finely focused electron beam of 2 μm diameter, enabling controlled sub-pixel mapping. The second method utilizes specially designed aperture masks with sub-pixel-sized holes to accurately localize electron entry points. We developed and validated two experimental strategies for collecting training data at acceleration voltages of 60, 80, 120, and 200 keV, which enable sub-pixel labeling for hybrid pixel detectors. Notably, our methodology is broadly applicable to a wide range of hybrid pixel detectors.",

    "title": "Role of Shafranov shift, zonal structures on the behavior of TAEs, AAEs and microinstabilities in the presence of energetic particles",
    "abstract": "In future nuclear fusion reactors, even a small fraction of fusion-born energetic particles (EP) about 100 times hotter than the thermal bulk species, contributes substantially to the kinetic pressure and therefore affect the MHD equilibrium, mainly via the Shafranov shift. In this work, we perform first-principles numerical simulations using the gyrokinetic, electromagnetic, global code ORB5 to study the effect of a self-consistent finite $β$ equilibrium on the arising Alfvén Eigenmodes (destabilized by EPs), Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG), and Kinetic Ballooning Modes (KBM) microturbulence (destabilized by thermal species). Linearly, we explore the complex interplay between EP fraction, bulk gradients and a self-consistent Shafranov shift on the plasma stability. We choose single toroidal mode numbers to represent the system's instabilities and study the characteristic nonlinear evolutions of TAEs, KBMs and ITGs separately and including the axisymmetric field response to each mode separately. This study focuses on the impact of Shafranov shift equilibrium consistency, as well as the self-generated zonal ${E \\times B}$ flows, the saturation levels and resulting heat and particle fluxes. In the ITG cases including the $n=0$ perturbations reduces turbulent fluxes, as expected, however, for the TAE cases including the $n=0$ perturbations is shown to enhance the fluxes. We show for the first time that Axisymmetric Alfvén Eigenmodes (AAEs) play a role in this mechanism.",

    "title": "Constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants",
    "abstract": "Tokamaks differ fundamentally from stellarators in the importance of the external coils for determining the magnetic field structure. Tokamak plasmas are in a self-organized state, especially when fusion rather than external heating dominates. Stellarator optimization focuses on the magnetic fields that can be produced by the coils. Tokamak optimization considers plasma profiles, which are largely determined by microturbulent transport and not easily controlled. A deviation of the profile of the plasma current over its full range of stability against disruptions produces only a small change, $\\sim 10\\%$, in the poloidal flux produced by the plasma current. This offers a simple explanation of why disruptions in tokamaks are so common, and why current-profile control though difficult may be required, especially during plasma shutdowns. The rapid temporal decay of $nτ_ET$ in high performance tokamak experiments shows the need for the careful control for other profiles. Here the focus is on the implications of Faraday's Law since important but new implications are easily derived. The context of the paper is twofold: (1) Simplified statements of the implications of the laws of physics, in particular Faraday's Law, which should be helpful in the design of tokamak power plants. (2) Thoughtful allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.",

    "title": "Performance Benchmarks for 2-View and 3-View Fiber-Projection Fine-Grained Particle Detectors",
    "abstract": "Fine-grained scintillator detectors are critical for precision measurements in nuclear and particle physics, where accurate reconstruction of interaction vertices and secondary particle directions enables separation of signal from background events. A well-known design choice is the fiber readout geometry: traditional 2-View systems use orthogonal X and Y fibers, while next-generation 3-View designs add a third Z-fiber layer that provides unambiguous 3D voxel identification. The 2-View approach suffers from combinatorial ghost hits, that the false 3D candidates arising from fiber projection ambiguities, degrading reconstruction performance in high-multiplicity events. This paper presents comprehensive simulation benchmarks quantifying the performance difference between 2-View and 3-View geometries across key metrics. We find that the 3-View geometry reduces ghost hits by 30--90\\% depending on event topology, provides robust vertex resolution across complex topologies, and maintains superior angular resolution for shower direction reconstruction. These benchmarks inform the design optimization of future detectors and provide quantitative guidance for reconstruction algorithm development across a broad range of experiments including neutrino physics, rare kaon/pion decays, and collider calorimetry.",

The primary purpose of the pair spectrometer is the precise determination of the flux of beam photons incident on the GlueX target, a critical input for physics analyses such as absolute cross-section measurements. The photon energy spectrum is determined by reconstructing electron-positron pairs produced in a thin converter inserted into the photon beam. The spectrometer is integrated into the GlueX trigger system, enabling continuous real-time monitoring of the photon flux and the recording of $e^+e^-$ pair candidates for offline analysis. In addition, the pair spectrometer provides a versatile test facility for evaluating calorimeter prototypes using leptons with well-defined energies produced via electromagnetic pair production.",

    "abstract": "We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.",

    "abstract": "Attosecond X-ray pulses are indispensable for exploring ultrafast phenomena in matter on Angstrom and attosecond scales. Here we propose a new method to realize spatiotemporal shaping of attosecond X-rays through temporal control of the orbital angular momentum mode content using an X-ray free-electron laser. The method exploits transverse-mode-dependent frequency pulling in a deliberately detuned second stage, together with slippage between the seed and the amplified radiation. Three-dimensional simulations show a double-spike waveform in which the two spikes carry different dominant topological charges. The spike separation is tunable and can reach several hundred attoseconds. This provides a source-level route to spatiotemporally structured attosecond X-rays with controllable temporal structure and topological mode content.",

    "abstract": "Online reconstruction is key for monitoring purposes and real time analysis in High Energy and Nuclear Physics experiments. A necessary component of reconstruction algorithms is particle identification that combines information left by a particle passing through several detector components to identify the particle's type. Of particular interest to electroproduction Nuclear Physics experiments such as CLAS12 is electron identification which is used to trigger data recording. A machine learning approach was developed for CLAS12 to reconstruct and identify electrons by combining raw signals at the data acquisition level from several detector components. This approach achieves an electron identification purity above 75% whilst retaining an efficiency close to 100%. The machine learning tools are capable of running at high rates exceeding the data acquisition rates and will allow electron reconstruction in real time. This work enhances online analyses and monitoring and can contribute to improved triggering at CLAS12. This machine learning driven approach will also be crucial for experiments aiming to transition to streaming readout operations where online reconstruction will be a key component of the data taking paradigm.",

    "title": "A radiation two-phase flow model for simulating plasma-liquid interactions",
    "abstract": "In laser-produced plasma (LPP) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources, deformation of a tin droplet into an optimal target shape is governed by its interaction with a pre-pulse laser-generated plasma. This interaction is mediated by a transient ablation pressure, whose complex spatio-temporal evolution remains experimentally inaccessible. Existing modeling approaches are limited: Empirical pressure-impulse models neglect dynamic plasma feedback, while advanced radiation-hydrodynamic codes often fail to resolve late-time droplet hydrodynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a radiation two-phase flow model based on a diffuse interface methodology. The model integrates radiation hydrodynamics for the plasma with the Euler equations for a weakly compressible liquid, extending a five-equation diffuse interface formulation to incorporate radiation transport, thermal conduction, and ionization. This formulation enforces pressure and velocity equilibrium across the diffuse interface region, with closure models constructed to ensure correct jump conditions at interfaces and asymptotically recover the pure-phase equations in bulk regions. Then, we apply the model to simulate a benchmark pre-pulse scenario, where a 50 micron tin droplet is irradiated by a 10 ns laser pulse. The simulations capture the rapid plasma expansion and subsequent inertial flattening of the droplet into a thin, curved sheet over microsecond timescales. Notably, the model reproduces experimentally observed features (such as an axial jet) rarely replicated in prior simulations. Quantitative agreement with experimental data for sheet dimensions and velocity validates the approach. The proposed model self-consistently couples laser-plasma physics with compressible droplet dynamics, providing a powerful tool for fundamental studies of plasma-liquid interactions in LPP-EUV source optimization.",

We report here the high-energy calibration of the detector using a Th-228 source, demonstrating linear response and an energy resolution of $(0.90 \\pm 0.02)$% FWHM at the Tl-208 photopeak (2615 keV). This performance extrapolates to a resolution at the double-beta decay end-point of $R(Q_{ββ})$ = $(0.93 \\pm 0.02)$% FWHM, confirming the detector's capability for precision energy measurement in the search for $ββ0ν$.",

    "title": "Wakefield Acceleration in a Layered Plasma Waveguide",
    "abstract": "Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches. The 2.5D particle-in-cell code was used to simulate the witness acceleration of an electron bunch by a wakefield created by drive electron bunches in a two-layer plasma wakefield accelerator. The simulation showed good agreement with the results of analytical calculations.",

    "title": "A New Beam Monitor at NFS/SPIRAL2 Based on Position-Sensitive PPACs Detecting Fission Fragments from ${}^{238}$U$(n,f)$",
    "abstract": "A new experimental setup has been installed at the Time-Of-Flight area of the Neutrons For Science facility (NFS) at GANIL/SPIRAL2 for neutron beam monitoring. This setup consists of an array of Position-Sensitive Parallel-Plate Avalanche Counters (PS-PPACs) that detects both fission fragments in coincidence from secondary neutron-induced fission reactions in several ${}^{238}$U targets. The neutron energy is determined on an event-by-event basis using the Time-of-Flight method, and the reaction point within the U targets is reconstructed, enabling the measurement of the neutron beam flux and beam profile. The high transparency of the setup allows it to operate in parallel with other experiments running at NFS, thus providing an in-beam monitor of the neutron intensity. In this work, we report on the characteristics of this new setup, its operating principle, and the first results obtained using the high-intensity white-spectrum neutron beam at NFS. This beam is produced via reactions between a primary 40-MeV deuteron beam, accelerated in the SPIRAL2 LINAC, and a 8 mm-thick rotating beryllium converter target.",

    "title": "Machine learning for radiative hydrodynamics in astrophysics",
    "abstract": "Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.   Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.   The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.   The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "During the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-29) ALICE will replace its three innermost tracking layers by a new detector, the \"ITS3\". It will be based on newly developed, wafer-scale monolithic active pixel sensors, which are bent into truly cylindrical layers and held in place by light mechanics made from carbon foam. Unprecedented low values of material budget (0.09\\% $X_0$ per layer) and proximity to the interaction point (19 mm) lead to a factor two improvement in pointing resolutions for particles from very low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ (O(100 MeV/$c$)), achieving, for example, 20 $μ$m and 15 $μ$m in the transversal and longitudinal directions, respectively, for 1 GeV/$c$ particles. After a successful R&D phase (2019-2023), which demonstrated the feasibility of this innovative detector and led to the Technical Design Report (https://cds.cern.ch/record/2890181/), the final sensor and mechanics are being developed right now.   This contribution will review the conceptual design and the main R&D achievements, as well as the current activities and road to completion and installation. It includes a projection of the improved physics performance, in particular for heavy-flavor mesons and baryons, as well as for thermal dielectrons that will come into reach with this new detector installed.",

We consider here the process in the lowest order of a perturbation theory relative to the electromagnetic (EM) beam intensity, giving contribution to the HOH generation. The main expressions are obtained for a general geometry, whyle polarizations of different sub-beams forming the EM beam focus are almost the same. Nevertheless, explicit expressions for the HOH generation are derived for the $4π$-dipole in-coming waves and for the two crossing Gaussian beams. The former geometry of the EM beam is optimal at a given EM wave power, whereas the latter one is more realistic from the experimental point of view. We consider also a relationship of our present general results with the results, obtained earlier for the HOH generation during of collision of two plane electromagnetic waves.",

    "abstract": "A state-of-the-art Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) facility, composed of a dedicated beamline and a 2D-RIXS spectrometer, has been constructed and commissioned at BL02U in NanoTerasu, Japan. This paper reports the optical design and optimization of this spectrometer, aiming for an ultrahigh energy resolution of <10 meV in the soft X-ray range. Conventional RIXS spectrometers using monochromatic incident X-rays suffer from a severe trade-off between energy resolution and measurement efficiency, which makes achieving resolutions of <10 meV practically unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we adopted the $hν^2$ concept using dispersive incident X-rays, based on a comparative study. This approach decouples the energy resolution from the incident bandwidth. We estimate that our 2D-RIXS spectrometer improves efficiency by more than a factor of 10 compared to conventional spectrometers. The 2D-RIXS spectrometer has been successfully commissioned, demonstrating that sub-10 meV resolution measurement is achievable with practical throughput. While development continues towards the ultimate design resolution, the successful implementation validates the design strategy and offers a pathway for future high-performance RIXS instrumentation.",

    "title": "Elaboration on the kinetic approach of Derbenev and Kondratenko to spin-polarized beams in electron storage rings",
    "abstract": "We present a detailed account of the kinetic approach for describing the effect of synchrotron radiation on electron and positron spin polarization in storage rings. This approach was introduced in 1974 by Derbenev and Kondratenko and was extended by us since 2001. The kinetic approach is much less frequently utilized but it is more general than the original non-kinetic approach of Derbenev and Kondratenko from 1972 since the kinetic approach is not centered on the invariant spin field. As with the non-kinetic approach the kinetic approach covers the radiative depolarization effect, the Sokolov-Ternov effect and its Baier-Katkov correction as well as the kinetic polarization effect but it enables the calculation of corrections to the original Derbenev-Kondratenko formulas and thereby provides estimates of the reliability of the latter. The kinetic appoach is applicable to storage rings with energies from a few GeV up to the energies of the FCC-ee and CEPC and beyond. The kinetic approach is based on the spin-orbit Wigner functions which lead to the so-called Bloch equation for the polarization density which is a generalization of Fokker-Planck equations to spin motion. In turn, as discovered in 2019, the Bloch equation is based on stochastic ordinary differential equations which can be used to develop Monte-Carlo spin-tracking codes covering the key effects beyond just radiative depolarization. These stochastic ordinary differential equations lead to a new viewpoint of the physical effects, in particular the kinetic polarization effect.",

    "abstract": "The plasma discharges in ADITYA Upgrade Tokamak are produced by means of transformer action, in which Ohmically created plasma is driven by means of a secondary loop voltage. Due to reduction of plasma resistivity after a certain level of plasma temperature, Ohmic heating becomes poor and further achievement of temperature needs other heating techniques. ADITYA-U tokamak is facilitated with a 42 GHz-500 kW Electron Cyclotron Resonant Heating (ECRH) system. Also, there is a Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system installed and operated at 3.7 GHz for driving non-inductive plasma current followed by the Ohmic current drive. Though an eventual impact in the rise of plasma temperature and plasma current due to the application of ECRH and LHCD respectively are very obvious, their energy coupling with the plasma results in several interesting outcomes in a number of experimentally measured plasma parameters. The present work addresses such impactful observations that are noticed and reported for the first time in ADITYA-U Tokamak.",

    "abstract": "Pattern discharge is a common mode in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and has broad application prospects in various industrial fields, such as material surface treatment, environmental monitoring, and biomedical applications. In this work, a mixed gas of 75% argon and 25% air is used to generate a pattern discharge. A double-gap boundary composed of hexagonal configuration and square configuration is employed, and the gas pressure is fixed at 20 kPa. By varying the applied voltage amplitude, single-ring pattern, square-point-line pattern, square lattice pattern, and annular-lattice pattern are obtained for the first time. The discharge characteristics and their temporal correlation are studied using both optical method and electrical method. The results show that the discharge patterns exhibit multiple discharges in each half of the voltage cycle, and these discharges are temporally correlated with each other. Time-resolved discharge images of the square lattice pattern are captured using an enhanced charge-coupled device (ICCD). The experimental results reveal that multiple discharges in a half-voltage cycle correspond to the ignition process of the pattern in the radial direction from the outside to the inside. The morphology of the square lattice pattern observed by the naked eye is actually the result of the temporal superposition of luminescence from points at different positions in the evolution process.",

We identify beam-correlated LAPPD data frames consistent with charged-current neutrino interactions observed in multiple detector subsystems, establishing the first detection of neutrino-induced Cherenkov light with an LAPPD.

    "title": "High-throughput Parasitic-independent Probe Thermal Resistance Calibration for Robust Thermal Mapping with Scanning Thermal Microscopy",
    "abstract": "Nanostructured materials, critical for thermal management in semiconductor devices, exhibit a strong size dependence in thermal transport. Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping in the micrometer (μm) length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantification of local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (< 100 nm). However, challenges in the accurate quantification of the raw signal to thermal conductivity and surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated thermal properties modulation in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of any parasitic heat transport pathways; thus, the calibration allows accurate determination of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature increase, thereby enabling extraction of the local thermal resistance of the film. In this study, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited via e-beam evaporation on SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using the finite element modeling-based calibration technique, where the average of the pixel-level Rc values yields the effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W/m.K, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks explaining heat transport modes in ultra-thin Al.",

    "title": "PANDA-film: an automated system for electrodeposition of polymer thin films and their wetting analysis",
    "abstract": "Thin polymer films are widely used as functional and protective coatings. However, determining the composition and processing conditions that produce a desired function is a tedious process due to the large number of factors that must be considered and the manual nature of most synthesis and characterization methods. Self-driving labs (SDLs), or robotic systems that prepare and test materials samples, are designed to overcome this bottleneck by enabling the efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. In this paper, we report the development and testing of the polymer analysis and discovery array (PANDA)-film, a modular SDL for electrochemically synthesizing polymer films and then determining their water contact angle as a measure of surface energy. The system is designed to be highly modular and based upon a lowcost gantry platform to facilitate adoption. In addition to validating fluid handling and electrochemical tasks, we introduce two novel modular capabilities that enable PANDA-film to run sustained campaigns to study the wetting properties of films: (1) an electromagnetic capping/decapping system to mitigate fluid evaporation, and (2) a top-down optical method to determine water contact angle based upon reflectance. These capabilities are validated by depositing and characterizing a poly(allyl methacrylate) (PAMA) film using electrodeposition of polymer networks (EPoN). Comprehensive details for replicating the hardware and software of PANDA-film are included.",

    "title": "Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments: A Hierarchical Taxonomy for Autonomous Large-Scale Facilities",
    "abstract": "The transition from automated data collection to fully autonomous discovery requires a shared vocabulary to benchmark progress. While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.",

This reveals that complex systems may possess hidden free energies protected by PT-symmetry and viscosity, albeit dissipative, can expose the systems to these freed energies by breaking PT-symmetry explicitly. Such a process is accompanied by instability and total variation growth.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the stability of crystalline undulator radiation (CUR) peaks emitted by 530 MeV positron channelling in periodically bent C(110) crystals with varying bending amplitudes and bending periods. Relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to quantify how these parameters affect the intensity and position of the CUR peak. The continuous potential approximation was used to identify isolines of constant peak energy, providing a reference for regions of spectral stability. MD results show that increasing the bending amplitude shifts the CUR peak to lower photon energies, while decreasing the period shifts it to higher energies, with both trends accompanied by enhanced dechannelling. For crystal parameters similar to recent experiments conducted at the MAinz MIkrotron (MAMI), the simulated CUR peak appears near 0.515 MeV. These results demonstrate that the CUR peak remains stable across a broad range of bending amplitudes and periods, establishing estimates of manufacturing tolerances for the design of gamma-ray crystal-based light sources.",

    "title": "Optimization of laser-driven proton acceleration in a near-critical-density plasma",
    "abstract": "Optimizing laser and plasma parameters is crucial for enhancing accelerated proton energy in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. Tight focusing plays a significant role in improving laser-driven proton acceleration, which is generally believed as a result of the enhancement of laser intensity. However, we find that even at a fixed laser intensity, reducing the focal spot size still enhances the proton energy. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at a small spot size (0.8 μm), the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 56.3% compared to that obtained at a conventional spot size (3 μm). This improvement is attributed to the dominance of ponderomotive-force-driven electrons at reduced spot sizes, which generate stronger charge-separation fields that propagate at higher velocities. Furthermore, to optimize proton acceleration, we analytically derive an ideal plasma density profile that promotes phase-stable proton acceleration, yielding an additional energy increase of 61.3% over the case of a tightly focused laser interacting with a planar target of uniform density. These findings remain robust under parameter variations, indicating that advanced focusing techniques combined with optimized plasma profiles could relax the demand for high laser energies, thereby reducing the reliance on large-scale laser facilities in medical and scientific applications.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the Säntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between the \"Category A\" and \"B\" pulses associated with the initial continuous current of upward negative leaders, and the \"Classical\" and \"Narrow\" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest that similar physical processes may be involved in the early stages of negative leader development in both upward and downward lightning, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.",

    "title": "Plasma Discharge Undulator: a novel concept for plasma-based radiation sources",
    "abstract": "Plasma discharge devices have recently emerged as compact and versatile tools for particle beam manipulation. Building upon the Active Plasma Lens (APL) and its curved extension, the Active Plasma Bending (ABP), this work introduces the concept of the Plasma Discharge Undulator (PDU). In a PDU, a high-current discharge within a capillary generates an azimuthal magnetic field providing strong linear focusing ($O(1)$ (kT/m)), while a controlled and periodical spatial modulation of the discharge axis acts as a geometric driving term. The resulting beam dynamics can be modeled as a forced harmonic oscillator, yielding a well-defined oscillation at wavelength $λ_{\\mathrm{PDU}}$, distinct from the natural betatron wavelength $λ_β$ related to APL focusing. Proper injection conditions result in the suppression of collective betatron oscillations, significantly reducing the intrinsic undulator strength spread typical of conventional plasma undulators, while allowing for matched beam transport thanks to APL strong focusing. Analytical models for particle trajectories and radiation emission are developed, and the one-dimensional requirements for free-electron laser (FEL) emission are evaluated, providing scaling relations and feasibility criteria for FEL operation in the proposed scheme. Theoretical estimates and multi-particle simulations indicate that the PDU can operate in the short-period regime ($λ_{\\mathrm{PDU}} = $ mm-cm) with tunable undulator strength $K_{\\mathrm{PDU}}$, supporting narrow-band radiation emission. The PDU thus provides a pathway toward miniaturized, tunable, fully-plasma-based light sources with enhanced control over focusing and spectral properties.",

    "title": "Constellation: The Autonomous Control and Data Acquisition System for Dynamic Experimental Setups",
    "abstract": "The operation of instruments and detectors in laboratory or beamline environments presents a complex challenge, requiring stable operation of multiple concurrent devices, often controlled by separate hardware and software solutions. These environments frequently undergo modifications, such as the inclusion of different auxiliary devices depending on the experiment or facility, adding further complexity. The successful management of such dynamic configurations demands a flexible and robust system capable of controlling data acquisition, monitoring experimental setups, enabling seamless reconfiguration, and integrating new devices with limited effort.   This paper presents Constellation, a flexible and network-distributed control and data acquisition software framework tailored to laboratory and beamline environments, that addresses the limitations of existing solutions. The framework is designed with a focus on extensibility, providing a streamlined interface for instrument integration. It supports efficient system setup via network discovery mechanisms, promotes stability through autonomous operational features, and provides comprehensive documentation and supporting tools for operators and application developers such as controllers and logging interfaces.   At the core of the architectural design is the autonomy of the individual components, called satellites, which can make independent decisions about their operation and communicate these decisions to other components. This paper introduces the design principles and framework architecture of Constellation, presents the available graphical user interfaces, shares insights from initial successful deployments, and provides an outlook on future developments and applications.",

    "title": "Self-organization of local streamline structures and energy transfer rate in compressible plasma turbulence",
    "abstract": "We examine how local streamline topology and energy cascade rate self-organize in plasma turbulence for both compressible and incompressible regimes. Using a fully-compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we quantify the subgrid-scale energy transfer and analyze its relationship to streamline structures by means of grandient tensor geometric invariants of the velocity field. Our results highlight how streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence: for nearly-incompressible fluctuations the energy is primarily transferred to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, while is back-transferred towards larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations, on the contrary, do not show a clear topological selection of the energy transfer since the overall direction of the local cascade rate is found to be determined by the sign of $-\\nabla\\cdot u$ (plasma volumetric compression or expansion).",
