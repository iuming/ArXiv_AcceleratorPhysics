  "title": "Optimized Broadband Cryogenic Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectrometer using a Closed Cycle Refrigerator",
  "abstract": "We present a vector network analyzer (VNA) based broadband cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectrometer, operating up to 20 GHz over a temperature range of 11 to 350 K. A cost effective architecture is implemented through the integration of a closed cycle refrigerator (CCR) and a custom fabricated grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW), designed for broadband transmission and reliable cryogenic operation. The VNA calibration is performed prior to measurements to account for microwave background and transmission losses, enabling reliable extraction of FMR spectra across the full temperature / frequency range. The sensitivity of the spectrometer is benchmarked using a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film, yielding well resolved resonances with narrow linewidths and high sensitivity.",
