  "title": "Talking with a ghost: semi-virtual coupled levitated oscillators",
  "abstract": "Mesoscopic particles levitated by optical, electrical or magnetic fields act as mechanical oscillators with a range of surprising properties, such as tuneable oscillation frequencies, access to rotational motion, and remarkable quality factors. Coupled levitated particles display rich dynamics and non-reciprocal interactions, with applications in sensing and the exploration of non-equilibrium and quantum physics. In this work, we present a single levitated particle displaying coupled-oscillator dynamics by generating an interaction with a virtual or ``ghost'' particle. This ghost levitated particle is simulated on an analogue computer, and hence its prperties can be dynamically varied. Our work represents a new angle on measurement-based bath engineering and physical simulation, and in the future could lead to the generation of novel cooling mechanisms and complex physical simulation.",
