  "title": "Applications of silicon carbide as window materials in atomic cells and atomic devices",
  "abstract": "Atomic cells made by anodically bonding silicon and borosilicate glasses are widely used in atomic devices.   One inherent problem in these cells is that the silicon material blocks beams with wavelengths shorter than   1000 nm, which limits available optical accesses when alkali metal atoms are involved. In this work, we   investigate the possibility of the silicon carbide material as an alternative of silicon materials in fabricating   anodically bonded cells. We demonstrate that the optical, thermal and mechanical properties of silicon carbide   help to improve the performance of atomic devices in certain applications.",
