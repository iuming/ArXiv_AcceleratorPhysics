  "abstract": "This book begins with the basic accelerator knowledge required to understand the latter chapters. This is followed by topics from Fermilab accelerator specifics to general accelerator physics concepts. These chapters are accompanied by descriptions of the instrumentation and utilities required to operate a high-energy physics laboratory. Last, we discuss the role of operators in safety at the lab.",
