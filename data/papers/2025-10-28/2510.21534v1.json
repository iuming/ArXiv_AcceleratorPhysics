  "title": "TES Proton Irradiation Result Analysis for Future Space Applications",
  "abstract": "As observed on the signal of the Planck-HFI highly sensitive bolometers, the effect of cosmic rays on detectors is a major concern for future similar space missions. Their instruments will have a larger detection surface, increased sensitivity, and more stringent requirements on the suppression of systematic effects. To study the impact of cosmic rays on detector prototypes in operational conditions, IAS has designed a state-of-the-art cryogenic system to irradiate particles by coupling this facility to particle accelerators. An irradiation campaign has been carried out on LiteBIRD-HFT TES prototypes to study their response to particle hits. In this article, we present the results and the analysis of this first test campaign.",
