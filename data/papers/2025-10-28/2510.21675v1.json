  "title": "Counter-Streaming Beams in Collisionless Pair Plasma Instability Systems   III: Collisionless Heating, Acceleration, and Radiation",
  "abstract": "Energetic astrophysical phenomena, such as $\\gamma$-ray bursts and supernova explosion-driven shocks in collisionless plasmas, involve various plasma kinetic instabilities, such as the Weibel instability. These systems support various types of particle acceleration and radiation through a variety of mechanisms. In this paper, we explore the energy transformations and dynamical effects of violent filament mergers seen between the large current filaments formed by the Weibel instability. The radiative processes involved in the Weibel instability filament building are also discussed in relation to jitter and synchrotron radiation.",
