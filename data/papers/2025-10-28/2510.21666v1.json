  "title": "Counter-Streaming Beams in Collisionless Pair Plasma Instability Systems   II: Spectral Cone and Spectral Wave Mode Analysis",
  "abstract": "Energetic astrophysical phenomena, such as $\\gamma$-ray bursts, supernova explosions, and magnetar flares occur in collisionless plasmas and involve various plasma kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. In this paper, we explore the spectral trends of the Weibel instability using spectral analysis of particle-in-cell simulations. Power dependence on viewing angle and frequency are explored and the relation to the results of the first paper in this series is discussed.",
