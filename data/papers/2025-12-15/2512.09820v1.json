  "title": "Scintillation response of cryogenic CsI to few-keV and sub-keV nuclear recoils",
  "abstract": "Monochromatic neutron emissions from photonuclear sources $^{88}$Y/Be and $^{124}$Sb/Be are employed to obtain the response of pure (undoped) cesium iodide at 80 K. The use of a low-noise, high-quantum-efficiency avalanche photodiode in combination with a novel waveshifter results in a 70 eV analysis threshold. This reach allows to observe signals from sub-keV nuclear recoils originating in neutron scattering. The extracted quenching factor drops much faster towards low energy than the extrapolation of a model developed for room-temperature CsI[Na]. We comment on the impact of our measurement on planned use of cryogenic CsI in neutrino physics and dark matter experiments.",
