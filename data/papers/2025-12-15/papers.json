    "title": "A low-cost ice melt monitoring system using wind-induced motion of mass-balance stakes",
    "abstract": "Surface ablation measurements of glaciers are critical for understanding mass change over time. Mass-balance stakes are commonly used for localized measurements, with the exposed length typically measured manually at infrequent intervals. This paper presents the design and validation of new instrumentation that automates mass-balance stake readings, thus enabling continuous measurements with high temporal resolution. The instrumentation comprises readout electronics that are mounted on mass-balance stakes to measure wind-induced vibrations. The stake vibrational frequency depends sensitively on the exposed length, and changes in the measured frequency therefore probe glacier surface melt and accumulation. Initial instrumentation field tests conducted at Color Lake on Umingmat Nunaat (Axel Heiberg Island), Nunavut, demonstrate centimeter-level precision on length measurements. The instrumentation can be attached to existing mass-balance stakes and is low-cost (~ $50 USD) in comparison to many other systems that perform automated surface ablation measurements. The accessibility of this instrumentation opens new possibilities for localized, high temporal resolution measurements of glacier surface activity at any locations where mass balance stakes are deployed.",

    "title": "Electromagnetic Noise Characterization and Suppression in Low-Field MRI Systems",
    "abstract": "Purpose: Low-field MRI systems operate at single MHz-range frequencies, where signal losses are primarily dominated by thermal noise from the radio-frequency (RF) receive coils. Achieving operation close to this limit is essential for maximizing imaging performance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, electromagnetic interference (EMI) from cabling, electronics, and patient loading often degrades system performance. Our goal is to develop and validate a practical protocol that guides users in identifying and suppressing electromagnetic noise in low-field MRI systems, enabling operation near the thermal noise limit.   Methods: We present a systematic, stepwise methodology that includes diagnostic measurements, hardware isolation strategies, and good practices for cabling and shielding. Each step is validated with corresponding noise measurements under increasingly complex system configurations, both unloaded and with a human subject present.   Results: Noise levels were monitored through the incremental assembly of a low-field MRI system, revealing key sources of EMI and quantifying their impact. Final configurations achieved noise within 1.5x the theoretical thermal bound with a subject in the scanner. Image reconstructions illustrate the direct relationship between system noise and image quality.   Conclusion: The proposed protocol enables low-field MRI systems to operate close to fundamental noise limits in realistic conditions. The framework also provides actionable guidance for the integration of additional system components, such as gradient drivers and automatic tuning networks, without compromising SNR.",

    "title": "Design optimization of hadronic calorimeters for future colliders",
    "abstract": "Calorimeters are a crucial component in modern particle detectors. They are responsible for providing accurate energy measurements of particles produced in high-energy collisions. The demanding requirements set for next-generation collider experiments impose new challenges on the design of new detectors, and a systematic approach to their optimization is increasingly necessary. The performance of calorimeters is primarily characterized by their energy resolution, parameterized by a stochastic and a constant term, related to sampling fluctuations and non-uniformities respectively. To improve the reconstruction quality of physics objects in the calorimeter, both terms need to be taken into account. Changes in a longitudinally constrained design usually result in a trade-off between these terms, making optimization a non-trivial task. This work focuses on the optimization of a hadronic sampling calorimeter, based on the FCC-ee ALLEGRO detector concept. By controlling the absorber layer thickness in a Geant4 simulation, the impact of the passive to active material proportion on the deposited energy distribution and resolution can be analyzed. Our methodology aims at exploring the design space with practical considerations, paving the way for the development of a closed optimization framework that can evaluate multiple designs against physics performance targets.",

    "abstract": "We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.",

Furthermore, two CeBr_{3} crystals with different thicknesses are used in order to study how detector efficiency is affected by crystal dimensions. A preliminary analysis of the data is presented.",

    "title": "An exploratory study of a tellurium-loaded liquid scintillator based on water and p-dioxane",
    "abstract": "Tellurium-loaded liquid scintillators are critical for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. However, conventional organic scintillators are constrained by the limited solubility of organic tellurium compounds compared with that of inorganic ones in water, whereas water-based scintillators are likely constrained by the destabilization of surfactants caused by inorganic tellurium compounds. In this work, a surfactant-free water-containing route is explored, in which an aqueous telluric acid solution is introduced into a water-miscible organic scintillator comprising p-dioxane, naphthalene, and PPO. The phase behavior of this system is mapped to delineate homogeneous-mixture domains and to estimate practical upper bounds on tellurium loading. Optical properties are characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The scintillation light yield is obtained with a relative method that compares to a reference LAB-PPO scintillator. The measurements demonstrate scintillation quenching induced by water and by tellurium acid. These results provide benchmarks for water-containing and surfactant-free formulations and support the development of high-loading liquid scintillators for future detector design.",

We, via fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, establish that the specific mode (e.g., space charge oscillations) and the current transport characteristics are essentially governed by the interplay between the electron beam energy and injected current density. A more generalized analysis is conducted for n-component electron beams, and a theoretical piecewise function is proposed, which agrees well with the PIC results under designed conditions. The discovery provides a mechanistic picture of multiple electron beam transport in diodes, paving the way for novel designs of high-performance modern vacuum electronic devices.",

    "abstract": "The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) presents a novel concept for observing gravitational waves from astrophysical sources at sub-Hertz frequencies. Compared to the Earth, the seismic environment of the moon, while uncertain, is known to be orders of magnitude lower, opening the possibility for achieving this sub-Hz band. This band fills the gap between space-based detectors (mHz) and Earth-based detectors (10 Hz to a few kHz). The initial version of LILA, known as LILA Pioneer, calls for non-suspended optics, relying on the moon's resonant modes to respond to gravitational waves. However, the follow-on design, LILA Horizon, requires suspensions to realize in-band free floating test masses and to filter the residual seismic background. This paper will establish baseline designs for these suspensions for different assumptions of the seismic background.",

Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis.

    "title": "Experimental and Monte Carlo Simulation Studies to Investigate the Working Principle of Compact Nanodosimeters",
    "abstract": "In recent years, compact nanodosimetric detectors based on ion multiplication in low-pressure gas have been developed and gained attention in the scientific community. These detectors use strong electric fields to collect and multiply positive ions produced by the incident radiation in mm-sized cell holes in dielectric materials, achieving a nm-equivalent spatial resolution of the localization of ionization events, when scaled to liquid water with unit density. Their design assumes that ion impact ionizations of gas molecules within the cell holes dominate signal formation, yet this assumption has lacked direct physical verification. Electron emission from the cell hole walls due to ion impact could also contribute, requiring alternative designs to optimize efficiency.   To investigate this, a nanodosimetric detector featuring a single cell hole with a diameter of 1.5 mm in a dielectric plate was developed. Ion collection and multiplication were achieved by applying a negative high voltage to the glass cathode 0.5 mm below the cell hole, assisted by a low drift field above the plate. A grounded readout electrode with a 0.8 mm hole covers the cell hole to prevent interactions of collected ions with the hole walls. High signal yields in 1 mbar and 2 mbar propane gas were observed and indicated that ion impact ionizations of the gas molecules are indeed the primary mechanism for signal induction. The compact nanodosimeter setup was further modeled with Geant4-DNA and Garfield++ for deeper insight. The results of these studies are important for understanding and developing a new class of nanodosimeters with potential applications in particle therapy, radiation protection, space dosimetry, and particle physics.",

    "abstract": "nEXO is a proposed next-generation experiment searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe using a tonne-scale liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chamber (TPC). To image the ionization signals from events in the liquid xenon, the detector will employ metallized fused-silica charge collection tiles instrumented with cryogenic application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), referred to as CRYO ASIC, which are designed to operate directly in LXe to minimize input capacitance and pick-up noise. Here we present the performance of the CRYO ASIC mounted on an auxiliary printed circuit board and evaluated both in a cryogenic environmental chamber and in a dedicated LXe test stand. We demonstrate that the ASICs achieve the desired performance at liquid xenon temperatures, showing a gain stability better than 0.2% over 24-hour operation and reliable in-situ calibration using an on-chip pulser. In the LXe test stand, we show that boiling caused by the chip heat dissipation can be mitigated by operating the system above ~0.1 MPa. The in-LXe noise measured agrees with simulation, which indicates it the $150~e^-$ design requirement can be satisfied. These results establish CRYO ASIC as a viable low-noise in-LXe charge readout solution for nEXO.",

    "title": "A Novel, Steerable, Low-Energy Proton Source for Detector Characterization",
    "abstract": "We report on the conversion of the Manitoba II mass spectrometer into a versatile low-energy proton beam facility. This infrastructure is adaptable to any detector-under-test (DUT), and has proven itself effective with the characterization of silicon detectors used in subatomic beyond-the-StandardModel (BSM) searches, namely the Nab experiment. A pencil beam of monoenergetic protons can be produced in a range from 25 keV to 35 keV, achieving a beamcurrent of ~1x10-18 A. Electrostatic steering plates were constructed to direct the Gaussian-profile proton beam over a 117mm diameter areaof-interest with full-width at half-maxima (FWHM) ranging from 0.6 mm to 1.26 mm. This work discusses the modifications and subsequent tests to confirm the beam specifications met the demands of the aforementioned detectors.",

    "abstract": "We present the performance of an efficient radon trap using silver-zeolite Ag-ETS-10, measured with a spherical proportional counter filled with an argon/methane mixture. Our study compares the radon reduction capabilities of silver-zeolite and the widely used activated charcoal, both at room temperature. We demonstrate that silver-zeolite significantly outperforms activated charcoal by three orders of magnitude in radon capture. Given that radon is a major background contaminant in rare event searches, our findings highlight silver-zeolite as a highly promising adsorbent, offering compelling operational advantages for both current and future dark matter and neutrino physics experiments. Furthermore, this not only offers great promise for developing future radon reduction systems in underground laboratories, but also paves the way for innovative, multidisciplinary advancements with far-reaching implications in science, engineering and environmental health.",

    "abstract": "Liquid argon time projection chambers have emerged as a competitive technology for detecting solar neutrinos. The SoLAr collaboration was formed to explore argon detectors with pixelated light and charge readout, aiming for high detection efficiency and improved energy resolution. Building on the success of an initial prototype, we present results obtained with a second SoLAr prototype (V2), a $30 \\times 30 \\times 30$ cm$^{3}$ time projection chamber operated in a cryostat containing several hundred kilograms of liquid argon. We report measurements of cosmic-ray muons using both tracking and calorimetry from light and charge sensors, and we highlight the improved performance achieved through combined charge and light reconstruction.

The ColdBox cryostat, detectors, neutron sources, and particle interactions are modeled and simulated using Fluka. A good agreement is found in the detected number of photoelectrons, with values below 650 photoelectrons in both data and simulation, for all four X-ARAPUCA photodetectors on the cathode in the LArTPC. A time constant is also fitted from the neutron-beam-off light signal spectrum and found consistent between data and MC. Several important systematic effects are discussed and serve as guides for future runs at larger LArTPCs.",

    "abstract": "Triaxial vibration sensor are widely used used in various application. Recently, low-cost sensors based on micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology are also becoming more widely adopted. However, their measurement accuracy can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature. In this study, we developed an environmental testing system integrated with a triaxial vibration exciter. The system can reproduce long-stroke, low-frequency triaxial vibrations -- such as those caused by huge earthquakes -- under temperatures ranging from $-30~^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ to $+80~^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Using this system, the measurement accuracy of vibration sensors can be evaluated under different environmental conditions. The system provides highly accurate reference measurements using a laser interferometer and reference accelerometers that are primarily calibrated within the system. The overall accuracy of the reference vibration measurement is estimated to be approximately 0.23~\\%. Based on these reference measurements, we investigated the accuracy of earthquake observations using a MEMS accelerometer as a demonstration. The system configuration and testing procedures are presented in this paper.",

    "abstract": "The safety-factor profile of a magnetically diverted tokamak plasma diverges logarithmically as the magnetic separatrix (a.k.a. the last closed magnetic flux-surface) is approached. At first sight, this suggests that, when determining the response of such a plasma to a static, externally generated, resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP), it is necessary to include an infinite number of rational magnetic flux-surfaces in the calculation, the majority of which lie very close to the separatrix. In fact, when finite plasma resistivity is taken into account, this turns out not to be the case. Instead, it is only necessary to include rational surfaces that lie in the region 0<Psi<Psi_c, where Psi is the normalized poloidal magnetic flux, and Psi_c<1 can be calculated from the edge plasma parameters. It is estimated that Psi_c= 0.9985 for an n=1 RMP, and Psi_c=0.9952 for an n=4 RMP, in a typical JET H-mode plasma.",

We suggest a possible set-up for an experiment or industrial application using state-of-the-art technology and we estimate the output power and photon rate expected to be received as a function of the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{aγγ}$. We find that, although challenging,this system has no physical restriction to render it unfeasible. Finally, we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of a hypothetical axion-based telecommunications system compared to traditional telecommunication systems. We then extend the discussion, noting the more important conclusions.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the matching conditions for self-guided laser pulse propagation in plasma and refine their formulation to maximize the energy of electrons produced via laser wakefield acceleration. Bayesian optimization, combined with particle-in-cell simulations carried out in a quasi-three-dimensional geometry and a Lorentz-boosted frame, is employed. The optimization identifies the maximum electron energy that a self-guided laser wakefield accelerator, driven by a laser of a given energy, can produce, together with the corresponding acceleration distance. Our results further demonstrate that electrons with energies close to the maximum value can be obtained across a relatively wide range of input parameters and without the need for their precise tuning. This provides substantial flexibility for experimental implementation and significantly relaxes the operational constraints associated with self-guided laser wakefield accelerators.",

By demonstrating broadband laser absorption spectroscopy of the $ν$2 fundamental vibrational mode of N2O molecules, we have determined the spectral range and established the spectroscopic potential of this laser. We have characterized the frequency noise and measured the line width of this new device, uncovering a discrepancy with the current consensus on the theoretical modeling of quantum cascade lasers. Our results confirm the potential of such novel narrow-line-width sources for vibrational spectroscopy. Extending laser spectroscopy to longer wavelength is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for a wide range of opportunities from chemical detection, to frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interaction with an extended variety of molecules, from ultra-cold diatomic species to increasingly complex molecular systems.",

    "abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been instrumental in recent advances in experimental high energy physics by colliding beams of protons and heavier nuclei at unprecedented energies. The present heavy-ion programme is based mainly on colliding lead nuclei. For future ion runs, there is strong interest to achieve a significantly higher integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity, which might be achieved through collisions of species other than Pb. In this paper, we explore the nucleon-nucleon luminosity projections in the LHC for a selection of ion species ranging from He to Xe, and including Pb as reference. Alternative beam production schemes are investigated as a way to mitigate effects such as space charge that degrade the beam quality in the LHC injectors. In the most optimistic scenarios, we find up to about a factor~4 improvement in integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity for a typical future one-month run, with respect to the present Pb programme. We also outline a future study programme and experiments to test the assumptions and refine the simulated projections put forward in this article.",

    "title": "Optimization of 3D diamond detectors with graphitized electrodes based on an innovative numerical simulation",
    "abstract": "Future experiments at hadron colliders require an evolution of the tracking sensors to ensure sufficient radiation hardness as well as space and time resolution to handle unprecedented particle fluxes. 3D diamond sensors with laser-graphitized electrodes are promising candidates due to their strong binding energy, small atomic number, and high carrier mobility. However, the high resistance of the engraved electrodes delays the propagation of the induced signals towards the readout electronics, thereby degrading the precision of the timing measurements. So far, this effect has been the dominant factor limiting the time resolution of these devices, with other contributions, such as those due to electric field inhomogeneities or electronic noise, typically neglected. Recent advancements in graphitization technology, however, motivate a renewed effort in modeling signal generation in 3D diamond detectors, to achieve more reliable predictions. To this purpose, we apply an extended version of the Ramo-Shockley theorem, describing the effect of signal propagation as a time-dependent weighting potential, obtained by numerically solving the Maxwell's equations in a quasi-static approximation. We developed a custom spectral method solver and validated it against COMSOL MultiPhysics. The response of the modeled sensor to a beam of particles is then simulated using Garfield++ and is compared to the data acquired in a beam test carried on in 2021 by the TimeSPOT Collaboration at the SPS, at CERN. Based on the results obtained with this simulation workflow, we conclude that reducing the resistivity of the graphitic columns remains the priority for significantly improving the time resolution of 3D diamond detectors. Once achieved, optimization of the detector geometry and readout electronics design will become equally important steps to further enhance the timing performance of these devices.",

    "title": "High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications",
    "abstract": "We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.",

    "title": "Generation of proton beams at switchback boundary-like rotational discontinuities in the solar wind",
    "abstract": "Alfvénic rotational discontinuities (RDs) are abundant in the inner heliosphere and can be used to model the boundary of switchbacks, i.e. Alfvénic magnetic kinks. To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\\perp/T_\\|\\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs. Finally, this paper underscores the importance of high-resolution observations of the solar wind velocity distributions around RDs.",

While liquid argon and liquid xenon TPCs have been extensively employed in the field of direct dark matter detection, successful development of LHe TPCs has not yet been achieved. Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K. At this temperature, electron mobility is three orders of magnitude higher than at approximately 4.0 K, which is the temperature we initially proposed for the LHe TPC.",

In this work, we present the design, construction, and characterization of a DC glow-discharge plasma chamber developed for the junior-level curriculum, a project carried out by two undergraduate students. The apparatus consists of a 1-meter-long quartz tube with a movable electrode, enabling systematic exploration of plasma behavior under varying pressure, voltage, and geometry. Using this platform, we characterized the Paschen breakdown relation and the voltage-current characteristics of the plasma. We then developed Langmuir probes to map spatial distributions of electron temperature and density, and used Boltzmann plot spectroscopy to measure excitation temperatures across different plasma regions. Finally, with custom Helmholtz coils, we demonstrated magnetic focusing of electrons. We performed Runge-Kutta simulations of particle trajectories and analyzed the electron drift velocity by comparing the focal lengths. Overall, this plasma chamber provides a versatile platform for investigating fundamental plasma phenomena and offers potential for future studies, including microwave-plasma interactions and other student-driven investigations.",

    "title": "Simulation of MAPS and a MAPS-based Inner Tracker for the Super Tau-Charm Facility",
    "abstract": "Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are a promising detector candidate for the inner tracker of the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). To evaluate the performance of MAPS and the MAPS-based inner tracker, a dedicated simulation workflow has been developed, offering essential insights for detector design and optimization.   The intrinsic characteristics of MAPS, designed using several fabrication processes and pixel geometries, were investigated through a combination of Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations were conducted with both minimum ionizing particles and $^{55}$Fe X-rays to assess critical parameters such as detection efficiency, cluster size, spatial resolution, and charge collection efficiency. Based on these evaluations, a MAPS sensor featuring a strip-like pixel and a high-resistivity epitaxial layer is selected as the baseline sensor design for the STCF inner tracker due to its excellent performance.   Using this optimized MAPS design, a three-layer MAPS-based inner tracker was modeled and simulated. The simulation demonstrated an average detection efficiency exceeding 99%, spatial resolutions of 44.8$\\rm{μm}$ in the $z$ direction and 8.2$\\rm{μm}$ in the $r-φ$ direction, and an intrinsic sensor time resolution of 5.9ns for 1GeV/c $μ^-$ particles originating from the interaction point. These promising results suggest that the MAPS-based inner tracker fulfills the performance requirements of the STCF experiment.",

    "abstract": "The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a key detector component for precise electron and photon measurements in electron-ion collision experiments. At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector.",

This primer therefore outlines essential concepts and requirements, which underpin solid-state laser cooling. The primer summarizes key milestones achieved with cooling-grade, rare-earth-doped glasses and crystals as well as with semiconductors.

    "abstract": "The critical current of superconductors is commonly measured by testing unloaded wires under an external magnetic field. While stressed by intense Lorentz forces, the existing HTS/LTS superconductors are prone to a reduction in critical current before reaching their structural mechanical limit. In this work, the magnetic and mechanical analysis of the FNAL 4-layer Bi-2212/Nb$_3$Sn hybrid dipole magnet is reported, aimed at predicting the critical current degradation for both the superconductors during powering at 16 T. All the Rutherford cables in the coils of the hybrid magnet were modeled at the strand level in Ansys APDL with the heterogeneous cable model. Utilizing this detailed geometry, it was possible to evaluate the effects of strain on the critical current degradation for both the Nb$_3$Sn and Bi-2212 superconductors under the intense Lorentz forces. The analysis presented in this paper integrates strain-dependent critical current laws, with parameters derived from experimental data, to simulate the hybrid magnet's performance for all possible current-powering configurations. The proposed methodology enables a detailed assessment of conductor integrity and I$_C$($\\varepsilon$) reduction in existing hybrid magnet designs, providing a versatile and rigorous framework for optimizing future high-field hybrid magnets.",

    "abstract": "Muon Colliders offer fantastic opportunities to explore new phenomena at the energy frontier. However, beam-induced-backgrounds from muon decays pose significant challenges for detector design, readout, and reconstruction. Previous detector studies have employed stringent hit-timing requirements to reduce occupancy to manageable levels with negligible efficiency loss for prompt Standard Model particles. In the spirit of maximizing discovery potential, we investigate the capability of detecting meta-stable charged long-lived particles at a 10 TeV Muon Collider. As a benchmark, we consider a Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) model in which the stau is long-lived and can be identified as a high momentum, slowly moving track. We find that nominal hit-timing selections are too restrictive, and investigate the impact of looser requirements. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover sensitivity to particles with masses close to $\\sqrt{s}/2$ by expanding time acceptance, and provide recommendations to further improve tracker design and track reconstruction.",

    "title": "Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant",
    "abstract": "Thea Energy, Inc. has developed the preconceptual design for \"Helios,\" a fusion power plant based on the planar coil stellarator architecture. In this overview paper, the design is summarized and the reader is referred to the other papers for more detail. The Helios design is based around a two-field-period quasi-axisymmetric (\"QA\") stellarator equilibrium with aspect ratio 4.5 and a novel tokamak-like X-point divertor. The natural stability, low recirculating power, and steady-state capability of the stellarator are leveraged. Stability and transport are calculated using state-of-the-art, high-fidelity codes and grounded in measured performance of existing experiments. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting (\"HTS\") and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. All coils are planar and convex. A maximum of 20 T on-coil is enforced, a value which has been achieved in existing large-bore HTS coils. There is a minimum of 1.2 m between plasma and coils, leaving space for tritium breeding blanket and neutron shielding. Because of this thick shielding, all coils have a minimum 40-year operational lifetime, the same minimum lifetime of the power plant system. 1.1 GW of thermal power and 390 MW of net electric power are produced. The shaping coils are individually controllable, enabling a uniquely configurable magnetic field for relaxed manufacturing and assembly tolerances and plasma control. A practical maintenance architecture is a primary driver of the design; maintenance is performed on entire toroidal sectors that are removed from between the encircling coils. A biennial maintenance cycle is estimated to take approximately 84 days, resulting in an 88% capacity factor. Rigorous engineering constraints such as temperature and stress limits are enforced.",

    "title": "Simulation of Muon-induced Backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE)",
    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of muon-induced backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), a shallow-underground facility with $\\approx 415$~m.w.e. overburden. Using coupled \\textsc{mute} and \\textsc{geant4} frameworks, we characterize the production and transport of muon-induced secondaries through site-specific rock compositions and geometries, establishing a proof-of-concept for high-precision, end-to-end simulations. Our simulations employ angular-dependent muon energy distributions, which improve secondary flux accuracy. For the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I research spaces, we predict total muon-induced neutron fluxes of $(8.52 \\pm 1.30_{\\text{sys}}) \\times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(8.86 \\pm 1.62_{\\text{sys}}) \\times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, we develop a Depth-Intensity Relation (DIR) to predict the muon-induced neutron flux as a function of facility depth, which is consistent with measurements across a broad range of underground depths. These results provide quantitative background predictions for experimental design and sensitivity projections at shallow- and deep-underground facilities. They further demonstrate that local geology and overburden geometry influence muon-induced secondary yields and energy spectra, emphasizing the need for site-specific simulations for accurate underground background characterization. Therefore, the simulation framework has been made publicly available at \\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17196581}{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17196581}, for the broader low-background physics community to enable meaningful inter-facility comparisons.",

    "title": "Modelling cosmic-ray transport: magnetised versus unmagnetised motion in astrophysical magnetic turbulence",
    "abstract": "Cosmic-ray transport in turbulent astrophysical environments remains a multifaceted problem and, despite decades of study, the impact of complex magnetic field geometry -- evident in simulations and observations -- has only recently received more focussed attention. To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behaviour emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterise particle-turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetised motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetised motion, characterised by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetised motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetised motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasise the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.",

    "title": "Identifying Neutron Sources using Recoil and Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy",
    "abstract": "Neutron-source identification is central to nuclear physics and its applications, from planetary science to nuclear security, yet direct discrimination from neutron spectra remains fundamentally elusive. Here, we introduce a Bayesian protocol that directly infers source ensembles from measured neutron spectra by combining full-spectrum template matching with probabilistic evidence evaluation. Applying this protocol to recoil and time-of-flight spectroscopy, we recover single- and two-source configurations with strong statistical significance ($>\\!\\!4σ$) at event counts as low as $\\sim\\!\\!10^{3}$. These results demonstrate that neutron spectral signatures can be leveraged for robust source identification, opening a new observational window for both fundamental research and operationally driven applications.",

    "title": "Partially Coherent X-Ray Oscilex Radiation from a FEL-Modulated Positron Bunch during Its Planar Channeling in a Crystalline Undulator",
    "abstract": "The radiation emitted at zero angle by a microbunched positron bunch undergoing planar channeling in a crystalline undulator (CU) is studied. The bunch energy is assumed to be far above the threshold for radiation generation in the dispersive CU medium. Besides the usual ``hard'' undulator radiation produced by channeling oscillations (channeling undulator radiation) and by the CU bending (crystalline undulator radiation), a ``soft'' medium-polarization component also appears at zero angle due to the oscillations that excite atomic electrons. We refer to this soft component as Oscilex (oscillationally-excited) radiation. Since the two types of oscillations have different frequencies, they yield two distinct frequency components of both undulator and Oscilex radiation. The Oscilex frequencies are set by the plasma frequency and the characteristic oscillation frequency and are, to high accuracy, independent of the positron energy. The CU period is chosen so that the radiation wavelength is not shorter than the microbunch length, ensuring coherent emission from microbunches and partially coherent Oscilex emission from the full bunch. Analytical expressions are obtained for the spectral line shapes and the number of photons of spontaneous Oscilex radiation. For partially coherent emission, Gaussian distributions are used for both the bunch and microbunches. Gain factors for the two Oscilex components, including longitudinal form-factors, and the total number of partially coherent photons are derived. A positron bunch with LCLS parameters, modulated by SASE XFEL, channeling between (1 1 0) planes of a periodically bent diamond crystal is analyzed. The number of spontaneously emitted Oscilex photons exceeds the number of positrons by $1\\text{÷}2$ orders of magnitude, and the gain factors reach $10^3 \\text{÷} 10^4$.",

The beam-beam effects qualitatively change search strategies relative to idealized mono-energetic lepton colliders, highlighting the importance of the low-energy part of the luminosity spectrum and additional beam-induced initial-state channels.

    "title": "Photon emission by vortex particles accelerated in a linac",
    "abstract": "We study the photon emission by charged spinless particles with phase vortices and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection in longitudinal electric and magnetic fields within the scalar QED. A realistic wave packet of an electron or ion accelerated by a radio-frequency wave locally feels a constant and spatially homogeneous field, which allows us to develop an effective model for losing the angular momentum of the vortex particle due to photon emission. For the fields typical for accelerator facilities, we find that an effective lifetime of the vortex state greatly exceeds the acceleration time. This proves that the acceleration of vortex electrons, ions, muons, and so forth to relativistic energies is possible in conventional linacs, as well as in the wake-field accelerators with higher field gradients, the OAM losses due to the photon emission are mostly negligible, and that the vortex quantum state is highly robust against these losses.",

    "title": "Evaluating Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) frameworks for the Accelerator Control System",
    "abstract": "As particle accelerator control systems evolve in complexity and scale, the need for responsive, scalable, and cost-effective computational infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offers an alternative to traditional monolithic architecture by enabling event-driven execution, automatic scaling, and fine-grained resource utilization. This paper explores the applicability and performance of FaaS frameworks in the context of a modern particle accelerator control system, with the objective of evaluating their suitability for short lived and triggered workloads. In this paper, we evaluate prominent open-source FaaS platforms in executing functional logic, triggers, and diagnostics routines. Evaluation metrics consist of cold-start latency, scalability, performance, integration with other open-source tools like Kafka. Experimental workloads were designed to simulate real-world control tasks when implemented as stateless FaaS functions. These workloads were benchmarked under various invocation loads and network conditions. Self-hosted FaaS platforms, when deployed within accelerator networks, offer greater control over execution environment, better integration with legacy systems, and support for real-time guarantees when paired with message queues. Based on lessons learned and evaluation metrics, this paper describes reliability of the FaaS framework for the Accelerator Control Systems (ACS).",

    "title": "Initial acquisition requirements for optical cavities in the space gravitational wave antennae DECIGO and B-DECIGO",
    "abstract": "DECIGO (DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) is a space-based gravitational wave antenna concept targeting the 0.1-10 Hz band. It consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with 1,000 km sides, forming Fabry-Pérot cavities between them. A precursor mission, B-DECIGO, is also planned, featuring a smaller 100 km triangle. Operating these cavities requires ultra-precise formation flying, where inter-mirror distance and alignment must be precisely controlled. Achieving this necessitates a sequential improvement in precision using various sensors and actuators, from the deployment of the spacecraft to laser link acquisition and ultimately to the control of the Fabry-Pérot cavities to maintain resonance. In this paper, we derive the precision requirements at each stage and discuss the feasibility of achieving them. We show that the relative speed between cavity mirrors must be controlled at the sub-micrometer-per-second level and that relative alignment must be maintained at the sub-microradian level to obtain control signals from the Fabry-Pérot cavities of DECIGO and B-DECIGO.",

    "title": "Damped Kinetic Alfvén Waves in Earth's Magnetosheath: Numerical Simulations and MMS Observations",
    "abstract": "The Earth's magnetosheath provides a high $β$ (ratio of electron thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) plasma environment where kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) strongly influence turbulence and energy dissipation. This study investigates how Landau damping modifies the nonlinear evolution of KAWs by solving a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation that captures both dispersive and nonlinear effects. Without Landau damping, modulational instability drives rapid self-focusing into intense magnetic filaments, producing a turbulent cascade with $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling in the inertial range ($k_\\perpρ_i<1$) that transitions to $k_\\perp^{-8/3}$ at sub-ion scales ($k_\\perpρ_i>1$), here $k_\\perp$ is the wavevector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field and $ρ_i$ the ion thermal gyroradius. When Landau damping is included, magnetic structures are significantly suppressed, and the spectrum steepens to $k_\\perp^{-11/3}$ in the sub-ion range while the inertial range maintains $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling. The damping acts across all scales through resonant wave-particle interactions, efficiently transferring energy from waves to particles. Direct comparison with Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations shows that the observed kinetic range spectral slope falls between our undamped and damped simulation limits, consistent with an intermediate damping regime in magnetosheath turbulence. This agreement confirms that Landau damping is one of the primary mechanisms controlling turbulent energy dissipation at kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas.",

The electron number density was determined from the Stark broadening of the Hα line shape of atomic hydrogen. It was shown that when laser radiation is focused in the region of a microwave plasma bunch, the Hα line shape in the hybrid plasma spectra has broad wings and is described by a Lorentz function with a two-contour approximation. The complex structure of the Hα line profile of the hybrid plasma indicates its spatiotemporal inhomogeneity. The electron number density corresponding to the contour with a smaller half-width exceeds the electron number density in microwave plasma and lies in the range of (4-8)E15 cm-3, and the electron number density measured by the contour with a larger half-width is (1.5-2)E17 cm-3.",

    "abstract": "The VIP collaboration operates a Broad Energy Germanium detector at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory to measure radiation in the few keV to 100 keV range, aiming to search for spontaneous collapse induced radiation and atomic transitions that violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Here we present a machine learning based upgrade for the BEGe detector using an event selection strategy aimed at improving the efficiency in detecting low energy events down to 10 keV. The method employs a denoising autoencoder to suppress electronic and microphonic noises and to reconstruct pulse shapes, followed by a convolutional neural network that classifies waveforms as normal single site or events with anomalies. The workflow was validated on a dataset comprising more than 20000 waveforms recorded in 2021. The classifier achieves a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.99 and an accuracy of 95 percent. Applying this procedure lowers the minimum detectable energy of the final spectrum to approximately 10 keV. It also yields a measurable enhancement in spectral quality, including an improvement of about 14 percent in the signal to background ratio and a reduction of the energy resolution for the characteristic Pb and Bi gamma lines. These developments enhance the sensitivity of the BEGe detector to rare low energy signals and provide a scalable framework for future precision tests of quantum foundations in low background environments.",

    "title": "Surface Ion-Sound Wave in Magnetic Arch With High Pressure Plasma",
    "abstract": "The work analytically substantiates the parameters of the surface wave found in numerical modelling of the collision of two oncoming supersonic plasma flows inside a magnetic arc in application to the experiment on the laboratory setup ``Solar Wind'' (Inst. Appl. Phys RAS). An ion-acoustic surface wave exists in the regime of dense plasma flows when their dynamic pressure is of the order of the pressure of an undisturbed magnetic field, so that the flows push the initial magnetic field out of their volume. The wave frequency is in the range between the ion gyrofrequencies inside the plasma bundle and in the outer region of the confining magnetic field. In the external rarefied medium, the near-surface structure is a heterogeneous magnetic sound, consistent in pressure and low total polarisation of the medium with the ``isotropic'' ion sound confined from the inside in a dense plasma bundle. The energy of the structure is mainly contained in the kinetic energy of the wave motion of ions inside the tube. At the same time, the electric field strength is sharply increased outside. Firstly, the latter circumstance arises from the need to maintain a uniform electron electric drift velocity inside the transition layer. Secondly, the energetically weak ion sound propagating into the outer environment is close to electrostatic ion oscillations below the ion gyrofrequency in the external region, which are characterised by increased electric field strength across the ambient magnetic field.",
