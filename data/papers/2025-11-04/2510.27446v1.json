  "title": "Modeling partially-ionized dense plasma using wavepacket molecular   dynamics",
  "abstract": "We develop a wave packet molecular dynamics framework for modeling the structural properties of partially-ionized dense plasmas, based on a chemical model that explicitly includes bound state wavefunctions. Using hydrogen as a representative system, we compute self-consistent charge state distributions through free energy minimization, following the approach of Plummer et al. [Phys. Rev. E 111, 015204 (2025)]. This enables a direct comparison of static equilibrium properties with path integral Monte Carlo data, facilitating an evaluation of the model's underlying approximations and its ability to capture the complex interplay between ionization and structure in dense plasma environments.",
