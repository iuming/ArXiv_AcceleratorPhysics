    "title": "Efficient and affordable thermoelectric measurement setup using Arduino and LabVIEW for education and research",
    "abstract": "Thermoelectric materials can convert thermal energy into electricity, making them promising candidates for harvesting waste heat, an increasingly important challenge in the energy-intensive modern world. The search for improved thermoelectric materials is therefore an active area of research in materials physics. Despite their fundamental and practical significance, thermoelectric properties - such as the Seebeck coefficient and power factor - are rarely explored in student labs due to the complexity in measurement schemes and requirement for sophisticated equipment. In this work, we present a user-friendly, low-cost and efficient thermoelectric measurement system built with Arduino and LabVIEW, which can simultaneously measure Seebeck coefficients and power factors as a function of temperature. This was made possible by improving the resolution of Arduino over ~1000 times with amplifiers and noise reduction schemes. With a total cost of only ~$100 and simple measurement protocols, this setup is well suited not only for student labs but also for efficient thermoelectric research.",

    "title": "Algorithms and optimizations for global non-linear hybrid fluid-kinetic finite element stellarator simulations",
    "abstract": "Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.   This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.   On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.   This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.",

As part of this detector technology, high-voltage electrodes are instrumental for the generation of observable signals and their physical interpretation. Thus, electrode design and manufacturing has to fulfill stringent requirements, and their production is associated with significant engineering challenges. In this work we describe the successful development of electrodes on the 1.5 m-scale, from their design and simulation to subsequent assembly and high-voltage testing in a gaseous argon environment. The produced electrodes were recently installed as an anode and a cathode during an upgrade to the XENONnT experiment.",

    "title": "On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations",
    "abstract": "We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the turbulent picture established by current numerical cosmological simulations. We use a high-resolution simulation of a Coma-like cluster and show that the simulation yields velocity structure functions and X-ray line-widths that are compatible with those measured by the XRISM observations of Coma. In particular, it has been previously suggested that a much steeper turbulence spectrum than the Kolmogorov would be needed to explain the XRISM observations under a homogeneous, cluster volume-filling turbulence model. Our results show that this tension is overcome thanks to the more complicated turbulent picture in cosmological simulations, that indeed shows a patchy distribution of turbulent regions in galaxy clusters, with a spectrum that is generally consistent with a Kolmogorov power-law over a fairly wide range of scales. More generally, our study highlights the fact that the interpretation of XRISM data of galaxy clusters depends on the turbulence model used and the importance of combining data and advanced simulations in the future steps.",

    "title": "Orbit-Controlled Generation of Two-color Attosecond Mode-locked Free-electron Lasers",
    "abstract": "The generation of attosecond X-ray pulses has garnered significant attention within the X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) community due to their potential for ultrafast time-resolved studies. Such pulses enable the investigation of electron dynamics with unprecedented temporal resolution, opening new avenues in fields such as quantum control and ultrafast spectroscopy. In an FEL, the mode-locking technique synthesizes a comb of longitudinal modes by applying spatiotemporal shifts between the co-propagating radiation and the electron bunch. Here, we propose a novel scheme for generating two-color attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses via orbit control in two-stage mode-locked undulators. Specifically, a chicane with a wiggler inserted in the middle generates periodic temporal-transverse modulation in the electron beam. In this configuration, the low-energy and high-energy components of the beam lase in separate undulator sections, with each producing attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses. Three-dimensional simulations with realistic parameters confirm that trains of 250-attosecond soft X-ray pulses at the gigawatt level can be independently generated in each undulator section. Furthermore, time delay between the two pulse trains can be adjusted over a range of several hundred femtoseconds.",

    "title": "Multiplexed SiPM Readout of Plastic Scintillating Fiber Detector for Muon Tomography",
    "abstract": "Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray muons to probe dense materials. A plastic scintillating fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact, high-resolution solution. However, scaling up the detector area and spatial resolution demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, this work presents a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the selection of suitable diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. Electronic tests show that the proposed design exhibits low crosstalk among electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range spanning a few to several hundred photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further demonstrate that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to direct readout. These results verify that the proposed method offers a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.",

    "abstract": "A Finite Volume (FV) scheme is developed for solving the extended magnetohydrodynamic (XMHD) equations, yielding accurate results in the ideal, resistive, and Hall MHD limits. This is accomplished by first re-writing the XMHD equations such that it allows the algorithm to retain the use of ideal MHD Riemann solvers and the constrained transport method to preserve divergence-free magnetic fields. Incorporation of electron inertia and displacement current introduces additional numerical stiffness which motivates a semi-implicit FV scheme that re-formulates the XMHD model as a relaxation system. The equations are then advanced in time using an explicit 2nd-order Runge-Kutta scheme with operator splitting applied to the implicit source term updates at each sub-stage. For additional numerical stability, density-dependent slope limiter is implemented to increase flux diffusivity at low density where non-ideal effects become significant. The algorithm is subsequently implemented on Artemis, a multifluid radiation hydrodynamics code built on Parthenon framework for high-performance computing (HPC) and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) support. As the new algorithm retains many aspects of the ideal MHD formulations, it asymptotes naturally to the ideal MHD limit. Moreover, it shows promising results at the resistive and Hall MHD limits. This is verified against published test problems for ideal, resistive and Hall MHD.",

This measurement is performed via detection of electrons and protons in delayed coincidence using custom large-area segmented silicon drift detectors. We present the characterization of one such detector system to establish the proton energy and timing response, using a dedicated proton accelerator. The detected proton peak was studied for 25 keV, 30 keV, and 35 keV incident protons on a set of detector segments and multiple cooling cycles over a one year period. Ionization losses were consistent with models of the detector dead layer with thicknesses less than 100nm. The detected proton peak was stable within the uncertainty from energy calibration (0.2 keV). The rise times of detector pulses from $^{109}$Cd and $^{113}$Sn conversion electron sources were used to extract the impurity density profile and establish a precise model for the detector timing response. The observed impurity density profile varied from $(2 \\pm 2) \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the center to $(26 \\pm 2) \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the edge. This impurity density profile was then used to characterize systematic effects in proton time-of-flight measurements due to detector pulse-shape effects; the resultant proton timing systematic uncertainties were below 0.3 ns, which is sufficient for the Nab experiment.",

In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials. This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics.",

We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.",

    "title": "Characterisation of X- and O-points in Wendelstein 7-X with respect to coil currents",
    "abstract": "This work analyses vacuum magnetic field topology in Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) with respect to changes in the current in the superconducting coils. We develop a fast automated scheme to locate fixed points (such as X- and O-points) and calculate the trace of the Jacobian of the field line map for them (Tr(M)), which represents several important properties of the fixed point. We perform two sets of coil current scans: (1) scans where each coil current is varied individually, using the \"standard\", \"high iota\" and \"low iota\" configurations as starting points; (2) a scan of over 200,000 magnetic configurations in which the coil currents are randomly sampled. In both cases we constrain the coil currents to the normal range of W7-X. We verify the principal roles of the non-planar, planar and control coils: the non-planar coils establish island chains with a certain phase; the planar coils modify the location of the island chain by both controlling the iota profile and shifting the configuration \"inward\" and \"outward\"; the control coil affects the island size and phase. We also find that |Tr(M)-2| (a quantity closely related to the magnitude of the Greene's residue) tends to increase with the minor radius of the fixed points, and that Tr(M) for X- and O-points can be very differently affected by the control coil current. Finally, we show that |Tr(M)-2| serves as a proxy for island size for internal island chains, which may help identification of suitable experimental candidates.",

    "title": "Turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath: space-time correlation using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission",
    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal correlation of magnetic field fluctuations is investigated using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The first observation of the turbulence propagator in space emerges through analysis of more than a thousand intervals. Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space-time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides unprecedented insight into the space-time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models.",

    "title": "High Density Hybridisation Using ENIG Bumping and Anisotropic Conductive Films",
    "abstract": "Fine-pitch hybridisation processes are essential for next-generation pixel detectors and high-density microelectronic assemblies. Conventional bump-bonding techniques, although reliable, remain costly and difficult to implement for single-die applications.   In this work, we present flip-chip hybridisation results combining Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) bumping with Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) bonding, both developed in-house. This method enables fine-pitch interconnections without requiring wafer-level processing.   The feasibility of the ENIG-ACF process for functional devices was demonstrated by hybridising functional Timepix3 ASIC and Ti-LGAD (Trench Isolated Low-Gain Avalanche Detector) sensors with 55 um pitch. The approach was then extended to test structures with 25 um pitch, using aligned-particle ACFs. The analysis revealed that the main limitation originated from the mismatch between ACF thickness and bump height, underlining the importance of interface geometry optimisation. To address this, a dedicated simulation program was developed to model the isotropic growth of ENIG bumps and to determine the optimum bump height as a function of ACF thickness and pixel-matrix geometry.   The results provide valuable guidelines for future high connection density assemblies and demonstrate the potential of the ENIG-ACF process as a scalable, low-cost alternative to conventional bump-bonding techniques.",

The one-liter detection volume monitor has been characterized well through experiment and to respond linearly to tritium concentrations for the range of $1 μCi/m^3$ to $1 Ci/m^3$. Additionally, it has been shown to behave nonlinearly for low voltage on the central anode and low pressure of the carrier gas. A computational model was developed from first principles that successfully describes the behavior of the one-liter monitor for each of these regimes. Predictions from the model are compared to previously-collected experimental data in order to determine validity and tune the model. The model will be expanded to incorporate additional detector geometries and designs in the future.",

    "abstract": "We study the energy delivered through a small-resistance series ``victim'' load during electrostatic discharge events in air. For gap lengths over 1~mm, the fraction of the stored energy delivered is mostly gap-length independent, with a slight decrease at larger gaps due to electrode geometry. The energy to the victim scales linearly with circuit capacitance and victim load resistance but is not strongly dependent on circuit inductance. This scaling leads to a simple approach to predicting the maximum energy that will be delivered to a series resistance for the case where the victim load resistance is lower than the spark resistance.",

    "title": "Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions",
    "abstract": "The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.",

    "title": "Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer",
    "abstract": "By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.",

    "abstract": "Depleted p-channel field effect transistor detectors with repetitive-non-destructive readout (RNDR-DEPFETs) achieve a deep sub-electron noise by averaging several independent measurements of one single event. During the repetitive readout collected electrons are transferred between two readout nodes within each pixel to enable electron number-resolved measurements. The pixels serve as a unit cell of an active pixel sensor to achieve a high level of parallelization and fast readout. These properties are exploited in the DANAE experiment, which aims for the direct detection of light dark matter based with the event signature of electron recoils. We present the experimental characterization of an $64\\times64$ RNDR-DEPFET pixel detector with a focus on the charge carrier generation rate. This technology achieves a high time resolution, which increases its sensitivity on rare events with a signal of two or more electrons due to the Poisson distribution of thermal generated electrons.",

    "title": "NuBench: An Open Benchmark for Deep Learning-Based Event Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes",
    "abstract": "Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.   We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of a magnetic signal scanning and imaging system based on the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect. The system employs a pair of performance-matched GMI sensing elements configured as a differential probe structure. Through co-optimized low-noise electronic and probe design, the system effectively suppresses both intrinsic sensor common-mode drift and external environmental magnetic noise, enabling high signal-to-noise ratio detection of nono-tesla to micro-tesla-level magnetic signals without magnetic shielding. Experimental results demonstrate that the differential system achieves significantly lower noise spectral density in unshielded environments compared to conventional GMI sensors (\\SI{46}{pT}/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ versus \\SI{286}{pT}/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at \\SI{1}{Hz}), with a sensitivity of 186,790 V/T and spatial resolution better than 200 micrometers. The system's excellent performance in weak magnetic field detection and spatial resolution was verified through scanning experiments of magnetic ink on US banknotes and magnetic reference samples. Compared to SQUID scanning systems, which requiring liquid helium cooling, this system based on the GMI effect offers advantages of room-temperature operation, compact structure, and low cost. Relative to conventional single-element GMI microscopes, it achieves significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and environmental adaptability. This research provides a practical solution for high-resolution magnetic field imaging at room temperature with broad application potential in materials magnetism, biomagnetic imaging, and nanomagnetic detection.",

    "title": "Impact of edge turbulence spreading on broadening the heat flux width with plasma approaching the density limit",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of edge turbulence spreading on broadening the heat flux width in Ohmic-plasma approaching the density limit of the J-TEXT tokamak. At the plasma edge, the EXB shear flow collapses while turbulence transport and spreading enhances significantly when approaching the density limit. The heat flux width increases with normalized density. An energy production ratio model is used to quantify the contribution of edge turbulence spreading to the origin of the SOL turbulence. Experimental data show that the energy production ratio is much larger than 1, indicating that turbulence spreading at separatrix is the origin of the SOL turbulence. The heat flux widths increase with edge turbulence spreading as well as the energy production ratio. The impact of blob-induced transport on the heat flux width is investigated in detail. Especially, the average blob-induced spreading is about 81% of the total edge spreading in the high-density scenario. Blobs with larger radial scales enhance edge spreading into the SOL, thus dominating the SOL turbulence and consequently broadening the heat flux width. These results suggest that edge turbulence spreading plays a crucial role in broadening the heat flux width as plasma approaches the density limit.",

While primarily used as a high-speed powder diffractometer, the high-performance area detector allows both texture characterisation and single-crystal measurements. The instrument can be configured over a large range of operational parameters, which are characterised in this contribution to aid experimental planning. Wombat is particularly optimised for the study of materials in situ and in operando using the wide range of sample environment available at the centre. Over 17 years of operation, Wombat has been used to explore a broad range of materials, including: novel hydrogen-storage materials, negative-thermal-expansion materials, cryogenic minerals, piezoelectrics, high performance battery anodes and cathodes, high strength alloys, multiferroics, superconductors and novel magnetic materials.

    "title": "Field Emission Analysis in SRF Cavities for PIP-II Using GEANT4",
    "abstract": "Field emission (FE) remains a significant hurdle for achieving optimal performance and reliability in super-conducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities used in accelerator cryomodules. A thorough understanding of the generation and propagation of FE-induced radiation is therefore essential to mitigate this problem. The absence of standardized measurement protocols further complicates the comparison of radiation data across different testing phases and facilities. This highlights the need for a precise quantitative method to diagnose and analyze FE-induced radiation. Such efforts could prove beneficial for improving cavity preparation and cleanroom assembly techniques during the prototype and production stages of Fermilab's Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) project. This study presents the initial steps of detailed Geant4 simulations aimed at analyzing FE-induced radiation in the low-beta 650 MHz 5-cell elliptical (LB650) cavity. Our goal is to combine these results with radiation diagnostics to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize detector positioning. This integrated approach ultimately aims to improve the preparation, assembly, and testing procedures for PIP-II SRF cavities, ensuring the delivery of FE-free cryomodules.",

    "title": "Proton specific entropy as a proxy for the $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ charge state ratio over heliocentric distance",
    "abstract": "While the fast solar wind has well-established origins in coronal holes, the source of the slow solar wind remains uncertain. Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below ~1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere.",

    "abstract": "The Fermilab Acceleraor Division, Beam Instrumentation Department, is always adopting modern and current software methodologies for complex DAQ architectures. This paper highlights the Redis Adapter (RA) as the key software component enabling high performance, modular communication between digitizers and distributed control systems by leveraging Redis and containerization. The RA provides a unified, efficient interface between Redis based data streams and consumer systems. In the legacy architecture, digitized data flowed through the custom, UDP based Distributed Data Communication Protocol in the middle layer. In the current system, DDCP remains the ingestion path, while the RA serves as the decoupling layer. The proposed system replaces old VME digitizers with a SOM-based digitizer that communicates with Redis using the RA. The RA acts as both a performance-critical bridge and a protocol-agnostic adapter, ensuring compatibility with legacy control frameworks while enabling future scalability and modularity. This restructuring of the middle layer also helps the system achieve high throughput, reduce latency, and simplify the data path. Finally, we will demonstrate how RA is utilized in our two core products to deliver both legacy compatibility and future flexibility.",

    "title": "Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy",
    "abstract": "Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics cause decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, primarily based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and measure defects only within narrow frequency bands and limited mode volumes, restricting insight into TLS behavior in isolated materials and interfaces. We introduce Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS), a broadband 3D waveguide technique that enables probing of TLS ensembles at cryogenic temperatures. Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands in TLS ensembles. The broadband, power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it well suited for studying dressed-state physics in driven TLS ensembles, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. By analyzing Fourier-transformed time-domain signals, BCTDS reveals eigen-mode frequencies of undriven TLS ensembles through characteristic V-shaped features and uncovers memory effects arising from interactions and broadband excitation. The modular method can be applied throughout device fabrication, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for quantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing. Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments. Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling process. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin temperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes at experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum information processing applications.",

    "title": "High-throughput Parasitic-independent Probe Thermal Resistance Calibration for Robust Thermal Mapping with Scanning Thermal Microscopy",
    "abstract": "Nanostructured materials, critical for thermal management in semiconductor devices, exhibit a strong size dependence in thermal transport. Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping at the micrometer length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantifying local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (<100 nm). However, challenges in accurately converting the raw signal to thermal conductivity and accounting for surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated modulation of thermal properties in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of parasitic heat transport pathways; this calibration enables accurate measurement of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature change to extract the thermal resistance of the film (Rth). Following calibration, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited by e-beam evaporation on a SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using a finite-element-modeling-based calibration approach, where the average of the pixel-level Rth values yields an effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W m^-1 K^-1, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks describing heat transport in ultrathin Al.",

The crystal was prepared with optical-grade surfaces and enclosed in a multi layer shielding system to suppress ambient light and background radiation. The detector response was studied at temperatures ranging from 100 K to room temperature. A figure of merit, defined as the ratio of the 59.5 keV peak position to the baseline resolution, showed a maximum at 175 K, indicating optimal photon detection efficiency. Pulse shape analysis demonstrated temperature-dependent variations in scintillation decay. At 175 K, the baseline resolution was sigma ~ 1 keV, corresponding to an effective threshold of ~ 3 keV. These results confirm the capability of the CsI(Tl) SiPM system to operate at low thresholds for rare-event searches and low-energy particle detection.",

    "title": "Initial performance results of the JUNO detector",
    "abstract": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) started physics data taking on 26 August 2025. JUNO consists of a 20-kton liquid scintillator central detector, surrounded by a 35 kton water pool serving as a Cherenkov veto, and almost 1000 m$^2$ of plastic scintillator veto on top. The detector is located in a shallow underground laboratory with an overburden of 1800 m.w.e. This paper presents the performance results of the detector, extensively studied during the commissioning of the water phase, the subsequent liquid scintillator filling phase, and the first physics runs. The liquid scintillator achieved an attenuation length of 20.6 m at 430 nm, while the high coverage PMT system and scintillator together yielded about 1785 photoelectrons per MeV of energy deposit at the detector centre, measured using the 2.223 MeV $γ$ from neutron captures on hydrogen with an Am-C calibration source. The reconstructed energy resolution is 3.4% for two 0.511 MeV $γ$ at the detector centre and 2.9% for the 0.93 MeV quenched Po-214 alpha decays from natural radioactive sources. The energy nonlinearity is calibrated to better than 1%. Intrinsic contaminations of U-238 and Th-232 in the liquid scintillator are below 10$^{-16}$ g/g, assuming secular equilibrium. The water Cherenkov detector achieves a muon detection efficiency better than 99.9% for muons traversing the liquid scintillator volume. During the initial science runs, the data acquisition duty cycle exceeded 97.8%, demonstrating the excellent stability and readiness of JUNO for high-precision neutrino physics.",

    "title": "Direct Neutron Detectors based on Carborane Containing Conjugated Polymers",
    "abstract": "Thermal neutron detectors are crucial to a wide range of applications, including nuclear safety and security, cancer treatment, space research, non-destructive testing, and more. However, neutrons are notoriously difficult to capture due to their absence of charge, and only a handful of isotopes have a sufficient neutron cross-section. Meanwhile, commercially available $^3$He gas filled proportional counters suffer from depleting $^3$He feedstocks and complex device structures. In this work, we explore the potential of a carborane containing conjugated polymer ($o$CbT$_2$-NDI) as a thermal neutron detector. The natural abundance of $^{10}$B in such a polymer enables intrinsic thermal neutron capture of the material, making it the first demonstration of an organic semiconductor with such capabilities. In addition, we show that thermal neutron detection can be achieved also by adding a $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitiser additive to the analogous carborane-free polymer PNDI(2OD)2T, whereas unsensitised PNDI(2OD)2T control devices only respond to the fast neutron component of the radiation field. This approach allows us to disentangle the fast and thermal neutron responses of the devices tested and compare the relative performance of the two approaches to thermal neutron detection. Both the carborane containing and the $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitised devices displayed enhancement due to thermal neutrons, above that of the unsensitised polymer. The detector response is found to be linear with flux up to $1.796\\,\\times\\,10^7\\,$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ n$_{th}\\bar{v}$ and saturates at high drive biases. This study demonstrates the viability of carboranyl polymers as neutron detectors, highlights the inherent chemical tuneability of organic semiconductors, and opens the possibility of their application to a number of different low-cost, scalable, and easily processable detector technologies.",

    "title": "Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields",
    "abstract": "Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (> 5σ) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.",

    "title": "Constraints on dark matter boosted by supernova shock within the effective field theory framework from the CDEX-10 experiment",
    "abstract": "Supernova shocks can boost dark matter (DM) particles to high, yet nonrelativistic, velocities, providing a suitable mechanism for analysis within the framework of the nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT). These accelerated DM sources extend the experimental ability to scan the parameter space of light DM into the sub-GeV region. In this study, we specifically analyze DM accelerated by the Monogem Ring supernova remnant, whose age ($\\sim 68000$ yr) and distance to Earth ($\\sim 300$ parsec) are strategically matched to enable detection with current terrestrial detectors. Utilizing the 205.4 kg$\\cdot$day data obtained from the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, we derive new constraints on boosted DM within the NREFT framework. The NREFT coupling constant exclusion regions now penetrate the sub-GeV mass range, with optimal sensitivity achieved for operators $\\mathcal{O}_{3}$, $\\mathcal{O}_{6}$, $\\mathcal{O}_{15}$ in the 0.4--0.6 GeV mass range.",

    "title": "The Formation of Solar Prominences: Plasma Origin and Mechanisms",
    "abstract": "Solar prominences, or solar filaments, are cool and dense plasma structures in the hot solar corona, whose formation mechanisms have remained a fundamental challenge in solar physics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical, numerical, and observational understanding of prominence formation, with a focus on the origin of the dense plasma component. We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors.",

    "title": "Determination of the total dose of bremsstrahlung X-RAY reminiscence on the high-current pulsed radiation-beam complex TEMP-B",
    "abstract": "The paper reports the results of measuring the total dose of X-ray bremsstrahlung from a powerful X-ray source based on the high-current pulsed direct-action electron accelerator Temp-B. The parameters of the high-current, tubular relativistic electron beam from the accelerator were as follows: energy 600 keV, current 13.5 kA, and pulse duration 1.0 mks. Using the pulsed magnetic field of a solenoid, the electron beam generated in a magnetically isolated diode was transported over a 55 cm distance toward the molybdenum converter. An auxiliary coil, connected in series with the solenoid, was placed adjacent to it to provide the desired magnetic field in the converter region and avoid beam losses. The methodology for determining the total dose of the produced X-ray bremsstrahlung is described. Polycrystalline detectors were used for measuring the X-ray bremsstrahlung dose. They were located 80 mm behind the converter in the polar plane, with a 20 deg separation. Measurements of the dose distribution over the polar angle showed symmetrical distributions of the radiation at both polar and azimuthal angles relative to the axis. Taking into account such symmetry and the fact that the electron beam radiates solely into the forward hemisphere, the integration over the entire sphere can be reduced to integration over just a fraction of 1/8 of the spherical surface, thereby reducing the required number of sensors. The experimentally obtained value of the total dose of the X-ray bremsstrahlung is 388.5 Gy per single pulse of the accelerator current, which is concentrated in a 120 deg cone in the direction of the beam movement.",

    "title": "Plasma oscillations within Israel-Stewart theory",
    "abstract": "It is well known that, at zero wavenumber, the non-hydrodynamic frequencies of uncharged kinetic theory are purely imaginary. On the other hand, it was recently shown that, in resistive magnetohydrodynamics, the interplay between the Israel-Stewart relaxation equation and the Ampère-Maxwell law can give rise to a pair of oscillating non-hydrodynamic modes. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in detail. We first demonstrate that these oscillatory modes are exact solutions of the Drude model, corresponding to ordinary plasma oscillations. We then invoke the Onsager-Casimir principle to explain that their oscillatory nature reflects the distinct PT-transformation properties of the degrees of freedom: the distribution function is even, while the electric field is odd. Finally, we establish that, in a kinetic theory of charged particles, there can be at most one such pair of oscillatory modes per spatial dimension, while all other modes still must sit on the imaginary axis.",

    "title": "Measuring the properties of homogeneous turbulence in curved spacetimes",
    "abstract": "Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.",

    "title": "MHD waves with mixed properties / Alfvén waves with pressure variations: a review",
    "abstract": "Non-uniformity plays an important role for MHD waves. For a uniform plasma of infinite extent the MHD waves can be subdivided in two classes with distinct properties. The first class contains the Alfvén waves. The Alfvén waves are incompressible and propagate parallel vorticity. They do not have a parallel component of displacement, they do not cause variations in pressure and are driven by magnetic tension only. The second class contains the magneto-sonic waves. They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfvén waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfvén waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfvén wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes.

We developed a coaxial wire scanning head to measure and correlate localized high-voltage discharge currents in air with high-resolution surface images. We find that the identified discharge 'hotspots' are transient and show no significant correlation with static visual features. Next, we established a quantitative relationship between artificially induced abrasive surface damage on the wires and a reduction in the discharge inception voltage. This work provides a novel non-invasive tool for qualifying wires dedicated for use in electrodes for future low-background experiments.",

    "title": "GRANITE: Mechanical Characterization and Optical Inspection of Large-Area TPC Electrodes",
    "abstract": "Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.   We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\\,μ\\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\\,μ\\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\\,μ\\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\\,μ\\text{m}$.   Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.",

    "title": "3D-printed components for electron-ion trapping: Pre-experimental tests of functionality and ultra-high vacuum compatibility",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at room temperature.",
