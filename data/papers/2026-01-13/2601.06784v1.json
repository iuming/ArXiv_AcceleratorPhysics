  "title": "Performance evaluation of Luxium Solutions BCF-XL wavelength-shifting fibers",
  "abstract": "We evaluate the performance of single-clad wavelength-shifting fibers newly developed by Luxium Solutions, BCF-92XL, BCF-9929AXL, and BCF-9995XL and compare them with the multi-clad Kuraray Y-11 fiber. The BCF-XL fibers exhibit faster decay times (92XL: $2.10\\pm0.01$ ns, 9929AXL: $2.10\\pm0.02$ ns, 9995XL: $2.41\\pm0.03$ ns) than Y-11 ($7.44\\pm0.06$ ns). The attenuation lengths are comparable to that of Y-11 within the measurement range up to 3.2 m. When coupled to an EJ-204 plastic scintillator, the BCF-XL fibers achieve superior time resolution while maintaining light yields comparable to those expected for a single-clad Y-11 fiber.",
