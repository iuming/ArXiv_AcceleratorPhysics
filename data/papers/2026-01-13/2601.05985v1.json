  "title": "Novel High-Radiopurity Doped Amorphous Silicon Resistors for Low-Background Detectors",
  "abstract": "We present the results of a study of lightly doped amorphous silicon used as a resistive medium for high-radiopurity resistors in nuclear and particle physics research instrumentation. Prototypes are produced for a Time Projection Chamber design for the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay search experiment that meet requirements for ultra-high radiopurity, good mechanical, cryogenic and high voltage performance, as well as useful vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) reflectivity. Further study is warranted to refine production methods and to confirm that the technology used here is useful for more general applications.",
