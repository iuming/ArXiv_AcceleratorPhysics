  "title": "Conservative formulation of the drift-reduced fluid plasma model",
  "abstract": "A conservative formulation of the drift-reduced fluid plasma model is constructed by analytically inverting the implicit relation defining the polarisation velocity as a function of the time-derivative of the electric field. The obtained model satisfies exact conservation laws for energy, mass, charge and momentum, in arbitrary magnetic geometry, also when electromagnetic fluctuations are included.",
