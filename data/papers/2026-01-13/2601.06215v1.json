  "title": "Improving TauFinder Reconstruction at a 10 TeV Muon Collider with the MAIA Detector Concept",
  "abstract": "This study aims to improve the TauFinder reconstruction algorithm for the MAIA detector concept. Through this work, we seek to increase the reconstruction efficiency and identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons. Through our work, we introduce a dynamic signal cone, known as a shrinking cone, which adjusts its size based on the transverse momentum of the tau candidate. In addition to the already studied one charged hadron and three charged hadron decay modes we extend TauFinder to include decays that consist of one charged hadron and up to two neutral pions. Furthermore, we have developed a tagger that prevents electrons being misidentified as one-prong tau candidates. Applying this tagger results in near-perfect electron rejection with negligible decrease in one-prong tau reconstruction efficiency.",
