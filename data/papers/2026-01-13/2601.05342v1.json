  "title": "Development of Design for the STS Extraction Magnet System",
  "abstract": "The Oak Ridge National Laboratory STS Project will enhance the Spallation Neutron Source by adding a new neutron source. The upgrade includes a 30% increase in beam energy and a 50% boost in beam current, doubling the accelerator's power capability to 2.8 MW. The Ring-to-Second-Target Beam Transport (RTST) system is vital in directing high-energy proton beams to the new second target station. New magnets have to fit into a restricted space within the existing beamline to add the new extraction line. New, fast kicker magnets (Pulsed Dipole), a focusing quad with an aperture for both beamlines (Large Quad) and the replacement of existing 21Q40 Quads with 'Narrow Quads' having identical fields as the existing design are Fermilab's responsibility. The design of these magnets poses unique challenges, as in addition to the high requirements on the quality of magnetic fields, they are subject to major restrictions related to their dimensions.",
