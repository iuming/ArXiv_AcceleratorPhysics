  "title": "Similarity Theory and Scaling Networks for Electromagnetic Wave-Driven Plasmas",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate the scale-invariant behavior of electromagnetic wave-driven radio-frequency plasmas across different dimensional scales. Using two-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations, we show that plasma uniformity remains the same in similar discharges. Building on the concept of similarity laws, we develop scaling networks that effectively relate plasma parameters across varying operating conditions. These results establish a generalized similarity theory derived from the Boltzmann equation coupled with the full set of Maxwell equations, extending the theoretical framework of similarity laws into electromagnetic regimes.",
