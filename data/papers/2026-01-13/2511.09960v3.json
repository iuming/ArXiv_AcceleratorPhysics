  "title": "High-throughput Parasitic-independent Probe Thermal Resistance Calibration for Robust Thermal Mapping with Scanning Thermal Microscopy",
  "abstract": "Nanostructured materials, critical for thermal management in semiconductor devices, exhibit a strong size dependence in thermal transport. Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping in the micrometer (μm) length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantification of local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (< 100 nm). However, challenges in the accurate quantification of the raw signal to thermal conductivity and surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated thermal properties modulation in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of any parasitic heat transport pathways; thus, the calibration allows accurate determination of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature increase, thereby enabling extraction of the local thermal resistance of the film. In this study, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited via e-beam evaporation on SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using the finite element modeling-based calibration technique, where the average of the pixel-level Rc values yields the effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W/m.K, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks explaining heat transport modes in ultra-thin Al.",
