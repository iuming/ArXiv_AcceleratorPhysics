  "title": "Non Destructive Testing",
  "abstract": "The contribution introduces the principles, methods, and applications of non-destructive testing in the context of particle accelerators and related technologies is presented. Both surface inspection methods (visual testing, penetrant testing, magnetic particle testing, eddy current testing) and volumetric methods (radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing) are presented, with examples drawn from CERN projects. Emphasis is placed on the capabilities, limitations, and practical considerations of each technique, highlighting their role in ensuring quality and safety during fabrication, procurement, and in-service inspections. The contribution also addresses standards, codes, and personnel qualification schemes, underlining their regulatory impact in fields such as pressure equipment and industrial piping. Finally, the importance of early integration of NDT into project planning is stressed, not only for compliance but also as a proactive quality and efficiency measure.",
