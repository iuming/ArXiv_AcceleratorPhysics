  "title": "Abnormal Polarity Effect on the DC Breakdown Voltage in Short SF6 Gap",
  "abstract": "In this Letter, through the comparison between experiment and numerical simulation, we reveal the dynamic mechanism underlying the abnormal polarity effect in SF6 short-gap DC breakdown, as well as a novel criterion for predicting negative breakdown voltage. Using the traditional single-streamer breakdown criterion, the simulated positive breakdown voltage agrees well with experimental measurements, whereas the simulated negative breakdown voltage deviates markedly from the experiments, so the single-streamer breakdown criterion fails to reproduce the abnormal polarity effect observed experimentally. In addressing this, we propose an ion-ion plasma breakdown criterion for negative breakdown voltage. When this novel criterion is applied, the simulated negative breakdown voltage agrees with the experiments and reflects the abnormal polarity effect. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of key physical parameters reveals that, the dynamic mechanism for ion-ion plasma breakdown for negative polarity can be divided into four stages: primary streamer stage, ion accumulation stage, reconstructive ionization stage, and ion-ion plasma propagation stage. Notably, the ion-ion plasma propagation stage is dominated by photoionization-driven negative-ion accumulation rather than conventional impact ionization.",
