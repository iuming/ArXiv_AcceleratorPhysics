  "title": "Fast Adaptive Neural Control of Resonant Extraction at Fermilab",
  "abstract": "We present progress on the development of a machine learning (ML) regulation system for third-order resonant extraction of the beam delivered to the Mu2e experiment at Fermilab. We consider classical and ML-based controllers optimized on semi-analytic simulations and provide performance comparisons for several models. Additionally, we discuss the efficiency of each model in training, which has implications for future work on adaptive control. We also discuss progress on developing optimized implementations of ML models for edge-based inference.",
