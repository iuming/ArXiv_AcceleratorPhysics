  "title": "Investigation of Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating Driven by Broadband Lasers",
  "abstract": "Broadband lasers have become a key strategy for mitigating laser plasma instabilities in inertial confinement fusion, yet their impact on collisional inverse bremsstrahlung (IB) heating remains unclear. Using one-dimensional collisional particle-in-cell simulations, we systematically examine the effect of bandwidth-induced temporal incoherence on IB absorption in Au plasmas. The simulations are first benchmarked against classical absorption theory, verifying that the implemented Coulomb collision model accurately reproduces the theoretical IB heating rate. A direct comparison of the electron temperature evolution in the broadband and monochromatic cases shows that, although spectral broadening introduces transient picosecond-scale oscillations in the heating rate driven by stochastic intensity fluctuations, the long-term averaged heating and net IB absorption remain essentially unchanged.",
