  "title": "Simulating neutron diffraction from deformed mosaic crystals in McStas",
  "abstract": "Monochromator and analyzer systems that rely on bent single crystals are in use throughout the neutron scattering community. We here introduce a new component to the neutron simulation software package McStas, that simulates these bent single crystals. We then compare the performance of this component to like software in SIMRES, and Ncrystal. These simulations show excellent agreement across the different software programs. Finally we compare simulations of the new McStas component with analytical calculations of secondary extinction, based on the Darwin transfer equations. Here we also find excellent agreement, further validating this new component.",
