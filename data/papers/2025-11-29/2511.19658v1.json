  "title": "Mechanical Design of the PIP-II ORBUMP Pulsed Dipole Magnet",
  "abstract": "The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) project is a vital upgrade to the Fermilab accelerator complex. The magnet pulse rate of the PIP-II Injection system requires an increase from the current rate of 15 Hz to 20 Hz as well as a roughly 30% increase in the magnetic field of the new Orbital Bump (ORBUMP) pulsed dipole magnets in the Booster. The ORBUMP magnet mechanical design is presented in this paper. The ORBUMP magnet is secured in a vacuum box and the core is made up of 0.127 mm thick, low carbon steel laminations with a C-5 inorganic magnesium phosphate coating. The core is clamped using external tie bars welded to the core end plates. ANSYS Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate the clamping design to minimize the deflection of the core post welding of the tie bars. The water-cooled, single turn coil, which shapes the magnetic field by acting as the pole tips, is critical for the integrated field homogeneity. The coil manufacturing tolerances and fabrication techniques were evaluated to ensure the magnetic properties of the magnet could be obtained. The coil is electrically isolated from the core using virgin Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) insulating material in the gap. An investigation into the high voltage performance of the virgin PEEK insulator was conducted via partial discharge testing using a 1:1 scale sample.",
