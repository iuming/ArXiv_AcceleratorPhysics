  "title": "Generation of Deep Ultraviolet Optical Vortices via Amplitude and Phase Spiral Zone Plates",
  "abstract": "We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.",
