  "title": "ALS-U AR RF Equipment Protection System",
  "abstract": "This paper presents the design and status of Accumulator Ring (AR) RF Equipment Protection System (EPS) of Advanced Light Source Upgrade project at LBNL. The key components of AR RF EPS include a Master Interlock PLC subsystem handling supervisory control and slow interlocks in \\SI{}{\\milli\\second} scale, an FPGA-based LLRF Controller managing fast interlocks in \\SI{}{\\micro\\second} scale, a 60 kW high-power amplifier with standalone PLC-based slow (\\SI{}{\\milli\\second} scale) and FPGA-based fast (\\SI{}{\\micro\\second} scale) protection systems, and an RF Drive Control Chassis acting as primary RF mitigation device. The design of AR RF EPS is presented along with internal RF and external AR subsystems interfaces.",
