  "title": "Transient spark dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode for dye degradation: A primary study",
  "abstract": "The potential application of non-thermal plasma in treating textile industrial wastewater motivates researchers to develop innovative techniques at a laboratory scale to achieve the goal of wastewater mineralization. In line with this objective, a dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode has been built for the study of synthetic dye degradation. The plasma reactor was optimized by altering various operating conditions to achieve a higher degradation efficiency at given discharge conditions. The reaction kinetics of crystal violet degradation were studied, and the same plasma reactor was tested for other synthetic dyes (wastewater model samples). The results suggest that the proposed dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor may offer a promising solution for treating dye effluents from the textile industry.",
