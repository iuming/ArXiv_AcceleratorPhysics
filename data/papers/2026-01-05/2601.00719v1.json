  "title": "Gravitational instability in partially ionized plasmas: A two-fluid approach",
  "abstract": "We propose a new two-fluid model for a partially ionized magnetoplasma under gravity, where electrons and neutrals are treated as a single fluid, and singly charged positive ions are a separate fluid. We observe that the classical result of gravitational instability (also known as Rayleigh-Taylor instability) in fully ionized plasmas is significantly modified by the influence of ion-neutral collisions (with frequency $ν_{\\rm{in}}$) and transverse wave numbers ($k_x$ and $k_y$). The instability growth rate can be enhanced or decreased depending on the values of the ratios $κ\\equiv k_x/k_y$ and $f\\equivν_{\\rm{in}}/Ω_{\\rm{ci}}$, where $Ω_{\\rm{ci}}$ is the ion-cyclotron frequency. We also estimate the growth rates relevant to the ionospheric E-region and solar atmosphere, noting that such growth rates can be maximized for $κ,~f\\ll1$, or for $κ>1$ and $f\\sim0.64$, and minimized for $f\\gg1$ irrespective of the value of $κ$. Furthermore, the timescale of instability ranges from $1$ minute to $2$ minutes in the solar atmosphere, while in the E region, it ranges from $1$ minute to $80$ minutes. The latter can be a satisfactory result for the reported lifetime of solar prominence threads.",
