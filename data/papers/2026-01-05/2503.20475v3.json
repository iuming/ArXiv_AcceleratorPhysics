  "title": "An electron-hadron collider at the high-luminosity LHC",
  "abstract": "We discuss a concept of a lower-energy version of the Large Hadron-electron Collider (LHeC), delivering electron-hadron collisions concurrently to the hadron-hadron collisions at the high-luminosity LHC at CERN. Assuming the use of a 20 GeV electron Energy Recovery Linac (ERL), we report the results on the optimised beam dynamics, accelerator technologies, and detector constraints required for such a \"phase-one\" LHeC. Finally, we also discuss the ERL configurations and the possibility of delivering electron-hadron collisions during the planned {Run5} of the LHC, which opens excellent research capabilities - the unique scientific potential of the proposed facility is outlined.",
