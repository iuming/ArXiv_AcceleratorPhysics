  "title": "Sensitivity of External Magnetic Field on the Change in Cross-section of a Toroidal Current",
  "abstract": "Due to any toroidal current column, the magnetic field is found to be sensitive as well as insensitive to its cross-sectional area depending on location of subject point, as predicted by numerical approaches [S. Aich, J. Thakkar, and J. Ghosh, Plasma Fusion Res. 17, 2403055 (2022)], and hence the presence of an angle of invariance is found to be present for any toroidal geometry. Present study aims to validate those numerical observations using the measured magnetic field due to Aditya Upgrade tokamak plasma.",
