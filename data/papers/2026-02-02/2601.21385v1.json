  "title": "A general framework for interactions between electron beams and quantum optical systems",
  "abstract": "We provide a theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of a free-electron beam interacting with quantized bound systems in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. This expands the quantum optics toolbox to incorporate free-electron beams for applications in highly tunable quantum control, imaging, and spectroscopy at the nanoscale. The framework recovers previously studied results and shows that electromagnetic environments can amplify the intrinsically weak coupling between a free-electron and a bound electron to reach previously inaccessible interaction regimes. We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics. Our framework is broadly applicable to microwave-frequency qubits, optical nanophotonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and emerging platforms at the interface of electron microscopy and quantum information.",
