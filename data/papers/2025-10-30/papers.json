    "title": "Design and characterization of a photosensor system for the RELICS   experiment",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a photosensor system developed for the RELICS experiment. A set of dynamic readout bases was designed to mitigate photomultiplier tube (PMT) saturation caused by intense cosmic muon backgrounds in the surface-level RELICS detector. The system employs dual readout from the anode and the seventh dynode to extend the PMT's linear response range. In particular, our characterization and measurements of Hamamatsu R8520-406 PMTs confirm stable operation under positive high-voltage bias, extending the linear response range by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, a model of PMT saturation and recovery was developed to evaluate the influence of cosmic muon signals in the RELICS detector. The results demonstrate the system's capability to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\\nu$NS) signals under surface-level cosmic backgrounds, and suggest the potential to extend the scientific reach of RELICS to MeV-scale interactions.",

    "title": "Effect of flow-aligned external magnetic fields on mushroom instability",
    "abstract": "Mushroom instability (MI) is a shear instability considered responsible for generating and amplifying magnetic fields in relativistic jets. While astrophysical jets are usually magnetized, how MI acts in magnetized jets remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a flow-aligned external magnetic field on MI, with both theoretical analyses and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In the limit of a cold and collisionless plasma, we derive a generalized dispersion relation for linear growth rates of the magnetized MIs. Numerical solutions of the dispersion relation reveal that the external magnetic field always suppresses the growth of MI, though MIs are much more robust against the external magnetic field than electron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (ESKHIs). Analyses are also extended to instabilities with an arbitrary wavevector in the shear interface plane, where coupling effect is observed for sub-relativistic scenarios. Two-dimensional PIC simulations of single-mode MIs reach a good agreement with our analytical predictions, and we observe formation of a quasi-steady saturation structure in magnetized runs. In simulations with finite temperatures, we observe the competition and cooperation between MIs and a diffusion-induced DC magnetic field.",

    "title": "Distributed Inter-Strand Coupling Current Model for Finite Element   Simulations of Rutherford Cables",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the Distributed Inter-Strand Coupling Current (DISCC) model. It is a finite element (FE) model based on a homogenization approach enabling efficient and accurate simulation of the transient magnetic response of superconducting Rutherford cables without explicitly representing individual strands. The DISCC model reproduces the inter-strand coupling current dynamics via a novel mixed FE formulation, and can be combined with the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) and Flux (ROHF) models applied at the strand level in order to reproduce the internal strand dynamics: hysteresis, eddy, and inter-filament coupling currents, as well as ohmic effects. We first analyze the performance of the DISCC model alone, as a linear problem. We then extend the analysis to include the internal strand dynamics that make the problem nonlinear. In all cases, the DISCC model offers a massive reduction of the computational time compared to conventional fully detailed FE models while still accounting for all types of loss, magnetization and inductance contributions. Rutherford cables homogenized with the DISCC model can be directly included in FE models of magnet cross-sections for efficient electro-magneto-thermal simulations of their transient response. We present two possible FE formulations for the implementation of the DISCC model, a first one based on the h-phi-formulation, and a second one based on the h-phi-a-formulation, which is well suited for an efficient treatment of the ferromagnetic regions in magnet cross-sections.",

    "abstract": "A next-generation medium-energy gamma-ray telescope targeting the MeV range would address open questions in astrophysics regarding how extreme conditions accelerate cosmic-ray particles, produce relativistic jet outflows, and more. One concept, AMEGO-X, relies upon the mission-enabling CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor silicon chip AstroPix. AstroPix is designed for space-based use, featuring low noise, low power consumption, and high scalability. Desired performance of the device include an energy resolution of 5 keV (or 10% FWHM) at 122 keV and a dynamic range per-pixel of 25-700 keV, enabled by the addition of a high-voltage bias to each pixel which supports a depletion depth of 500 um. This work reports on the status of the AstroPix development process with emphasis on the current version under test, version three (v3), and highlights of version two (v2). Version 3 achieves energy resolution of 10.4 +/- 3.2% at 59.5 keV and 94 +/- 6 um depletion in a low-resistivity test silicon substrate.",

    "title": "Phase-Space Shaping in Wakefield Accelerators due to Betatron Cooling",
    "abstract": "Plasma-based accelerators are beginning to employ relativistic beams with unprecedented charge and ultrashort durations. These dense driver beams can drive wakes even in high-density plasmas ($\\gtrsim10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$), where betatron radiation becomes increasingly important and begins to affect the dynamics of the accelerated beam. In this Letter, we show that betatron cooling leads to a strong, structuring of the phase space of the beam. This gives rise to bunched, ring-like structures with positive radial position and momentum gradients, \\emph{i.e.}, population inversion of the amplitude of oscillation. We derive the characteristic timescales for this process analytically and confirm our predictions with multi-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations. The radiation-dominated regime of beam dynamics fundamentally alters the acceleration process and produces self-structured beams capable of triggering coherent betatron emission in ion channels.",

    "title": "Noise Estimation and Suppression in Quantitative EMCD Measurements",
    "abstract": "Quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables the measurement of magnetic moments with elemental and atomic site sensitivity, but its practical application is fundamentally limited by noise. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in EMCD measurements, demonstrated on Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, we systematically analyze the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across individual energy channels using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure based on the neighboring Ba-M4,5 edges with an adequate energy upsampling is introduced to minimize systematic errors from energy misalignment. The impact of detector noise, particularly from CMOS-based EELS cameras, is evaluated through variance-to-mean analysis and described by the noise amplification coefficients, revealing that detector-amplified shot noise is the dominant noise source. We recommend a stricter SNR threshold for reliable EMCD detection and quantification, ensuring that critical spectral features such as the Fe-L2,3 peaks meet the requirements for quantitative analysis. The approach also provides a framework for determining the minimum electron dose necessary for valid measurements and can be generalized to scintillator-based or direct electron detectors. This work advances the reliability of EMCD as a quantitative tool for magnetic characterization at the nanoscale with unknown magnetic structures. The proposed procedures lay the groundwork for improved error handling and SNR optimization in future EMCD studies.",

    "title": "Miniaturized magnetic-field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers",
    "abstract": "The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of $1.25 \\mathrm{mm}$. On its tip, a direct laser writing process is used to fixate a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise-limited magnetic-field sensitivity of $5.9 \\mathrm{nT}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \\mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \\mathrm{mW}$. Using lock-in techniques, we measure a sensitivity of $51.8 \\mathrm{nT}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. Moreover, controlled guiding of excitation light to the diamond while avoiding sample illumination may enable operation in light-sensitive environments such as biological tissue. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.",

    "abstract": "The DAMA experiment's long-standing claim of dark matter detection remains a key open issue in astroparticle physics. Independent verification requires NaI(Tl)-based detectors with enhanced low-energy sensitivity. Current detectors rely on photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which features limited detection efficiency, intrinsic radioactivity, and high noise at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project that developed a proof of concept NaI(Tl) detector where siliconphotomultipliers (SiPMs) have been used instead of PMTs, offering higher photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most of all, a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the dark noise. The setup includes a custom cryostat operating at approximately 80 K. We report the first characterization of an approximately 360 g NaI(Tl) crystal coupled to a 5 x 5 cm SiPM matrix, yielding 4.5 photoelectrons\\keV after crosstalk correction. This promising result demonstrates the feasibility of SiPM-based readout for NaI(Tl) and paves the way for future large-scale dark matter experiments.",

    "title": "Physics-Informed Visual MARFE Prediction on the HL-3 Tokamak",
    "abstract": "The Multifaceted Asymmetric Radiation From the Edge (MARFE) is a critical plasma instability that often precedes density-limit disruptions in tokamaks, posing a significant risk to machine integrity and operational efficiency. Early and reliable alert of MARFE formation is therefore essential for developing effective disruption mitigation strategies, particularly for next-generation devices like ITER. This paper presents a novel, physics-informed indicator for early MARFE prediction and disruption warning developed for the HL-3 tokamak. Our framework integrates two core innovations: (1) a high-fidelity label refinement pipeline that employs a physics-scored, weighted Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to systematically correct noise and artifacts in raw visual data from cameras, and (2) a continuous-time, physics-constrained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) model that predicts the short-horizon ``worsening\" of a MARFE. By conditioning the model's dynamics on key plasma parameters such as normalized density ($f_G$, derived from core electron density) and core electron temperature ($T_e$), the predictor achieves superior performance in the low-false-alarm regime crucial for control. On a large experimental dataset from HL-3, our model demonstrates high predictive accuracy, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.969 for 40ms-ahead prediction. The indicator has been successfully deployed for real-time operation with updates every 1 ms. This work lays a very foundation for future proactive MARFE mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Advances in scintillation crystal and Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM) technologies have enabled the development of compact, lightweight, and low-power radiation detectors that are suitable for integration with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This integration enables efficient and cost-effective large-area radiation monitoring while minimising occupational exposure. In this work, a SiPM-based NaIL scintillation detection payload was developed, characterised, and mounted on a multirotor UAV for gamma ray and neutron source localisation and activity estimation applications. To support these capabilities, an analytic radionuclide detection efficiency model was developed and used to estimate radioactivity on the ground from aerial energy spectrum measurements. The analytic expression for the detection efficiency incorporated physical phenomena, including the branching ratio, detector solid angle, air attenuation, and intrinsic peak efficiency, leading to agreement within 10% of experimental radionuclide detection efficiencies. The UAV-based radiation detection system was physically validated through a controlled indoor live radioactive source demonstration at 1.5 m, 3 m, and 4.5 m flight heights. Using the developed ground-level radioactivity estimation method, Cs-137 and Co-60 sources were successfully localised within 0.5 m, and their activities were estimated with errors on the order of 10% or less.",

    "abstract": "Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), as the core photoelectric sensor for coherent neutrino detection in low-temperature pure CsI, its working performance directly determines the measurement accuracy of the scintillator light yield. Our previous research has fully demonstrated the performance of pure CsI at liquid nitrogen temperature. More intriguingly, its performance is expected to be even better at 40 K. However, the performance characteristics of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range still remain to be explored. In this study, a self-developed adjustable temperature control system ranging from 30 K to 293 K was built to investigate the key performance parameters of SiPM at different temperatures, such as single photoelectron spectrum, gain, breakdown voltage, dark count rate, after-pulse, internal crosstalk, and single photoelectron resolution. Special emphasis was placed on examining the key performance parameters of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range to evaluate its feasibility for light yield measurement in this temperature range. The results show that this study obtained the parameter variation trends and optimal working conditions of 3 types of SiPM at different temperatures, thereby improving the sensitivity of the detector. This research provides important technical support for low-temperature detection in neutrino physics experiments.",

    "title": "The XLZD Design Book: Towards the Next-Generation Liquid Xenon   Observatory for Dark Matter and Neutrino Physics",
    "abstract": "This report describes the experimental strategy and technologies for XLZD, the next-generation xenon observatory sensitive to dark matter and neutrino physics. In the baseline design, the detector will have an active liquid xenon target of 60 tonnes, which could be increased to 80 tonnes if the market conditions for xenon are favorable. It is based on the mature liquid xenon time projection chamber technology used in current-generation experiments, LZ and XENONnT. The report discusses the baseline design and opportunities for further optimization of the individual detector components. The experiment envisaged here has the capability to explore parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter down to the neutrino fog, with a 3$\\sigma$ evidence potential for WIMP-nucleon cross sections as low as $3\\times10^{-49}\\rm\\,cm^2$ (at 40 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass). The observatory will also have leading sensitivity to a wide range of alternative dark matter models. It is projected to have a 3$\\sigma$ observation potential of neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe at a half-life of up to $5.7\\times 10^{27}$ years. Additionally, it is sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos from the sun and galactic supernovae.",

    "title": "Tritiated methane reduction in the PandaX-4T experiment via purge and   cryogenic distillation processes",
    "abstract": "Tritium from tritiated methane (CH$_3$T) calibration is a significant impurity that restricts the sensitivity of the PandaX-4T dark matter detection experiment in the low-energy region. The CH$_3$T removal is essential for PandaX-4T and other liquid xenon dark matter direct detection experiments, as CH$_3$T serves as a critical component for low-energy calibration. To eliminate CH$_3$T, the xenon in the detector is suitably recuperated, leaving 1.8 bar of xenon gas inside, and the detector is flushed with heated xenon gas. Concurrently, leveraging the lower boiling point of methane relative to xenon, the PandaX-4T cryogenic distillation system is effectively utilized to extract CH$_3$T from xenon after optimizing the operational parameters. Following the commissioning run, 5.7 tons of xenon are purified via the distillation method. Recent data indicate that the CH$_3$T concentration reduces from $3.6\\times10^{-24}$ mol/mol to $5.9\\times10^{-25}$ mol/mol, demonstrating that gas purging and distillation are effective in removing CH$_3$T, even at concentrations on the order of $10^{-24}$ mol/mol.",

    "title": "Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark   matter halos: origin of the NFW profile",
    "abstract": "Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating in the pre-assembled halo develops an $r^{-\\gamma}$ inner density cusp, accretion and relaxation in which develops an $r^{-\\beta}$ outer fall-off with $\\beta \\approx 5 - 2\\gamma$ in the quasi-steady state. Spherical collapse theory dictates that a quasi-steady outer halo must settle to $\\beta \\approx 3$, for which the mass enclosed within a shell barely changes with time. This implies that $\\gamma\\approx 1$, which is possible in the quasilinear framework only if (i) the pre-assembled halo harbors an $r^{-\\gamma_{\\mathrm{P}}}$ profile with $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{P}} \\gtrsim 0.5$, (ii) its fluctuations are correlated in time (red noise), and (iii) the initial value of $\\gamma$ is smaller than $1$, implying that the $r^{-1}$ cusp is a neutral equilibrium. We demonstrate for the first time how the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile emerges as a quasi-steady state of collisionless relaxation.",

Here we present scaled laboratory experiments based on laser-driven plasma outflow into magnetized ambient gas, which mimic five basic astrophysical outflows regulated by interstellar medium, namely collimated jets, blocked jets, elliptical bubbles, as well as spherical winds and bubbles. Their morphologies and existence conditions are found to be uniquely determined by the external Alfvenic and sonic Mach numbers Me-a and Me-s, i.e. the relative strengths of the outflow ram pressure against the magnetic/thermal pressures in the interstellar medium, with transitions occurring at Me-a ~ 2 and 0.5, as well as Me-s ~ 1. These results are confirmed by magnetohydrodynamics simulations and should also be verifiable from existing and future astronomical observations. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding astrophysical outflows.",

    "title": "Exploring an image-based $b$-jet tagging method using convolution neural   networks",
    "abstract": "Jet flavor tagging, the identification of jets originating from $c$-quarks, $b$-quarks, and other quarks (light quarks and gluons), is a crucial task in high-energy heavy-ion physics, as it enables the investigation of flavor-dependent responses within the hot and dense nuclear medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, several methods based on deep learning techniques, such as deep neural networks and graph neural networks, have been developed. These deep-learning-based methods demonstrate significantly improved performance compared to traditional methods that rely on track impact parameters and secondary vertices. In the tagging algorithms, various properties of jets and constituent charged particles are used as input parameters. We explore a new method based on images surrounding the primary vertex, utilizing charged particles within the jet cone, which can be measured using a silicon tracking system. For this initial experimental study, we assume the ideal performance of the tracking system. To analyze these images, we employed convolutional neural networks. The image-based flavor tagging method shows an 80-90% $b$-jet tagging efficiency for jets in the transverse momentum range from 20 to 100 GeV/$c$. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of jet flavor tagging in high-energy nuclear physics experiments.",

    "title": "Removal of spallation-induced tritium from silicon through diffusion",
    "abstract": "Tritium, predominantly produced through spallation reactions caused by cosmic ray interactions, is a significant radioactive background for silicon-based rare event detection experiments, such as dark matter searches. We have investigated the feasibility of removing cosmogenic tritium from high-purity silicon intended for use in low-background experiments. We demonstrate that significant tritium removal is possible through diffusion by subjecting silicon to high-temperature (> 400C) baking. Using an analytical model for the de-trapping and diffusion of tritium in silicon, our measurements indicate that cosmogenic tritium diffusion constants are comparable to previous measurements of thermally-introduced tritium, with complete de-trapping and removal achievable above 750C. This approach has the potential to alleviate the stringent constraints of cosmic ray exposure prior to device fabrication and significantly reduce the cosmogenic tritium backgrounds of silicon-based detectors for next-generation rare event searches.",

    "title": "Three Dimensional Theory of the Ion Channel Laser",
    "abstract": "The ion channel laser (ICL) is a plasma-based alternative to the free electron laser (FEL) that uses the electric field of a uniform-density ion channel rather than the magnetic field of an undulator to induce transverse oscillations of electrons in an ultrarelativistic bunch and thereby produce coherent radiation via a collective electromagnetic instability. The powerful focusing of the ion channel generally yields significantly higher gain parameters in the ICL as compared to the FEL. This permits lasing in extremely short distances using electron bunches with an energy spread as large as a few percent; a value readily achievable with current plasma-based accelerators. ICLs, however, impose stringent transverse phase space requirements on the electron bunch beyond what is required in FELs. In this work, we present a novel 3D theory of the planar off-axis configuration of the ICL that accounts for a number of effects including diffraction, transverse radiation profile, frequency and betatron phase detuning, and nonzero spread in energy and undulator parameter. We derive the ICL pendulum and field equations, which we use to write down the 3D Maxwell-Klimontovich equations. After linearizing, we obtain an integro-differential equation describing the $z$-evolution of the radiation field. The 3D ICL dispersion relation is obtained using a Van Kampen normal mode expansion. We numerically solve the $z$-evolution equation to compute radiation power growth rates and transverse radiation profiles over a range of different ICL parameters. We examine the gain reduction due to 3D effects, energy spread, and emittance. Electron bunch phase space and emittance requirements for lasing are derived. Finally, we make general observations about the performance and feasibility of the ICL and discuss future prospects.",

    "abstract": "Hall Magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) extends ideal MHD by incorporating the Hall effect via the induction equation, making it more accurate for describing plasma behavior at length scales below the ion skin depth. Despite its importance, a comprehensive description of the eigenmodes in HMHD has been lacking. In this work, we derive the complete spectrum and eigenvectors of HMHD waves and identify their underlying topological structure. We prove that the HMHD wave spectrum is homotopic to that of ideal MHD, consisting of three distinct branches: the slow magnetosonic-Hall waves, the shear Alfv\\'en-Hall waves, and the fast magnetosonic-Hall waves, which continuously reduce to their ideal MHD counterparts in the limit of vanishing Hall parameter. Contrary to a recent claim, we find that HMHD does not admit any additional wave branches beyond those in ideal MHD. The key qualitative difference lies in the topological nature of the HMHD wave structure: it exhibits nontrivial topology characterized by a Weyl point-an isolated eigenmode degeneracy point-and associated nonzero Chern numbers of the eigenmode bundles over a 2-sphere in k-space surrounding the Weyl point.",

    "abstract": "We consider the use of digital signal processing to reconstruct continuous reflectance spectra using a small finite set of randomly illuminated light emitting diodes (LEDs). We simulate the use of LEDs having identical spectral distance and Gaussian bandwidth whose illumination overlaps its nearest neighbors. An object, whose reflectance spectrum is to be determined, is illuminated by a series of random spectral patterns consisting of randomly chosen LEDs with random intensity. We quantify the information within the illumination patterns using the singular value decomposition (SVD) and reconstruct reflectance spectra, specifically hemoglobin and several green vegetation spectra using the pseudoinverse of the SVD for a given amount of noise. We show that for sparse plant spectra, it is possible to reconstruct the continuous green vegetation spectra with RMSE less than 1% with as few as 25 LEDs. Our study demonstrates that reconstructing sparse reflectance spectra based on random structured illumination can enable low-cost LED-based cameras to perform equally well as expensive cameras, especially for dedicated applications.",

CATAP provides a structured and coherent interface to a control system, allowing researchers and operators to centralize higher-level control logic and device information. This greatly reduces the amount of code that a user must write to perform a task, and codifies system knowledge that is usually anecdotal.

    "abstract": "Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) data analysis often relies on fixed-width binning schemes that overlook variations in signal strength and structural complexity. We introduce a statistically grounded approach based on the Freedman-Diaconis (FD) rule, which minimizes the mean integrated squared error between the histogram estimate and the true intensity distribution. By deriving the competing scaling relations for counting noise ($\\propto h^{-1}$) and binning distortion ($\\propto h^{2}$), we establish an optimal bin width that balances statistical precision and structural resolution. Application to synthetic data from the Debye scattering function of a Gaussian polymer chain demonstrates that the FD criterion quantitatively determines the most efficient binning, faithfully reproducing the curvature of $I(Q)$ while minimizing random error. The optimal width follows the expected scaling $h_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\propto N_{\\mathrm{total}}^{-1/3}$, delineating the transition between noise- and resolution-limited regimes. This framework provides a unified, physics-informed basis for adaptive, statistically efficient binning in neutron scattering experiments.",

    "title": "Quantum Kinetic Modeling of KEEN waves in a Warm-Dense Regime",
    "abstract": "We report a fully kinetic, quantum study of Kinetic Electrostatic Electron Nonlinear (KEEN) waves, showing that quantum diffraction systematically erodes the classical trapping mechanism, narrow harmonic locking to the fundamental, and hasten post-drive decay. Electrons are evolved with a second-order Strang-split 1D1V Wigner-Poisson solver that couples conservative semi-Lagrangian WENO advection to an analytic Fourier space update for the non-local Wigner term, while ions remain classical. Short, frequency-tuned ponderomotive pulses drive KEEN formation in a uniform Maxwellian plasma; as the dimensionless quantum parameter H rises from the classical limit to values relevant to warm-dense matter, doped semiconductors, and 2D electron systems, the drive threshold increases, higher harmonics are damped, trapped electron vortices diffuse, and the subplasma electrostatic energy relaxes to a lower stationary level, as confirmed by continuous wavelet analysis. These microscopic changes carry macroscopic weight. Ignition-scale capsules now compress matter to regimes where the electron de Broglie wavelength rivals the Debye length, making classical kinetic descriptions insufficient. By extending KEEN physics into this quantum domain, our results offer a potential diagnostic of nonequilibrium electron dynamics for next-generation inertial-confinement designs and high-energy-density platforms, indicating that predictive fusion modeling may benefit from the integration of kinetic fidelity with quantum effects.",

    "abstract": "Fiber optic pulsed polarimetry is a LIDAR-like fiber sensing technique that uses a backscatter enhanced single mode backscatter-tailored optical fiber(BTOF) to measure the distributed B fields on all Magnetic Fusion Energy devices. The BTOF has a series of wavelength resonant reflection fiber Bragg gratings written uniformly along its length. The fiber's Verdet constant determines the strength of the Faraday effect which effectuates the measurement of local B along the fiber placed intimately next to or within a magnetized plasma volume. A robust measurement of the field distribution along the fiber is obtained at high rep rates, 5 MHz, high spatial resolution(1-10cm), high B field accuracy(<1%) and temporal response (ns). Multipathing in the BTOF produces 3rd order reflections that contaminate the LIDAR signal. Algorithms are given for calculating the level of contamination for uniform and flat reflection designs, in particular and any reflection series in general. The contamination is bracketed giving confidence in designing and implementing a BTOF. Applications include magnetic fusion devices, rail guns, high temperature superconducting magnets and magnetized target fusion research.",

    "abstract": "Dark matter, which is considered to account for approximately the 27% of the Universe's energy-mass content, remains an open issue in modern particle physics along with its composition. The CYGNO Experiment aims to exploit an innovative approach applied to the direct detection search of low energy nuclear recoils possibly induced by cold particle-like dark matter candidates. CYGNO employs a directional detector based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with a He:CF$_{4}$ gas mixture and equipped with an optical readout. Currently, the CYGNO Collaboration is constructing the detector demonstrator, CYGNO-04, in Hall F at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). This 0.4 m$^3$ detector has the goal of proving the scalability of the technology and assessing the physics and radiopurity capabilities. Given the low radioactivity requirements, especially in internal components such as field cage and cathode, the reduction of material while keeping the correct electrical behavior is paramount. In this paper, we present the validation of several internal components, mainly focusing on the field cage material and support structure. The tests included geometrical asymmetries in the electric field response, collection efficiency as well as measurement of known physical quantities. A preferred configuration is found with a structure based on Nylon material which supports a PET or Kapton sheet with copper strips deposited on.",

    "title": "THz mixing of high-order harmonics using $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-δ}$   nanobridges",
    "abstract": "Superconducting materials are a key for technologies enabling a large number of devices including THz wave mixers and single photon detectors, though limited at very low temperatures for conventional superconductors. High temperature operation could in principle be offered using cuprate superconductors. However, the complexity of the material in thin film form, the extremely short coherence length and material stability, have hindered the realization of THz devices working at liquid nitrogen temperatures. $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\\delta}}$ (YBCO) nanodevices have demonstrated non-linear properties typical of Josephson-like behavior, which have the potential for the mixing of AC signals in the THz range due to the large superconducting energy gap. Here, we present AC Josephson functionalities for terahertz waves utilizing Abrikosov vortex motion in nanoscale-confined fully planar YBCO thin film bridges. We observe Shapiro step-like features in the current voltage characteristics when irradiating the device with monochromatic sub-THz waves (100 GHz to 215 GHz) at 77 K. We further explore these nonlinear effects by detecting THz high-order harmonic mixing for signals from 200 GHz up to 1.4 THz using a local oscillator at 100 GHz. Our results open a path to an easy-fabricated HTS nonlinear nanodevice based on dimensional confinement suitable for terahertz applications.",

    "title": "Coherently Enhanced Axion-Photon Conversion via Seeded Photons for   Short-Pulse Axion Detection",
    "abstract": "We propose a seeded axion-photon conversion scheme to enhance the sensitivity of light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) experiments for axion detection, where the axions are generated from short pulse lasers and the usual resonant cavity is not applicable. By injecting a weak, coherent seed electromagnetic (EM) field into the axion-photon conversion region, the axion-induced EM field can constructively interfere with the seed field, amplifying the number of regenerated photons to a level exceeding that of the unseeded scenario. We evaluate the expected signal enhancement, statistical limits from Poisson counting with seed fluctuations and background, and the potential improvement in coupling sensitivity. Compared to a standard LSW setup, the seeded scheme can achieve orders-of-magnitude higher photon yield per axion, potentially surpassing resonance-enhanced experiments in certain parameter regimes. This approach presents a promising pathway to extend the reach of laboratory axion searches, particularly in scenarios where the resonant cavities are impractical.",

This limit is equal to c $\\tau$ ( c is the speed of light and $\\tau$ is the laser pulse duration) corresponding to the length of the atmosphere contributing to the wind speed measurement at one distance. To go beyond this limit, we use an inverse problem approach based on a model of the spectrogram (concatenation of periodograms of each range) and prior distributions on our unknowns: backscattering amplitude and wind speed at each range. We apply our inversion method to simulated and experimental spectrograms, demonstrating a gain in resolution by a factor of 2 to 2.5 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.",

The propagator is essentially a Green function for the neutral kinetic equation, which depends on the plasma profiles. A Neural Network (NN) based model for the propagator provides a fast and accurate solution for the neutral distribution function in plasma. Furthermore, continuous and smooth dependence of NN-based reconstruction of the propagator on the plasma parameters opens the possibility for using this approach with Jacobian-based methods for time-integration and root finding.

    "title": "Search for Invisible Decay Modes in Nuclear Gamma Cascades of a   ${}^{46}$Sc Source Using a CsI (Tl) Detector",
    "abstract": "Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in modern physics, motivating extensive searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\\gamma$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\\&M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a \"missing gamma\" technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance--disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range. This result highlights the sensitivity of the missing-gamma technique and motivates the development of a larger-scale detector with improved systematic control to extend dark-sector searches into previously unexplored regions of parameter space.",

    "title": "Global linear drift-wave eigenmode structures on flux surfaces in   stellarators: ion temperature gradient mode",
    "abstract": "Turbulent transport greatly impacts the performance of stellarator magnetic confinement devices. While significant progress has been made on the numerical front, theoretical understanding of turbulence in stellarators is still lacking. In particular, due to nonaxisymmetry, different field lines couple within flux surfaces, the effects from which have yet to be adequately studied. In this work, we numerically simulate the linear electrostatic ion-temperature-gradient modes in stellarators using the global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code GTC. We find that the linear eigenmode structures are nonuniform across field lines on flux surfaces and are localized at the downstream of the ion diamagnetic drift. Based on a simple model from Zocco et al. [Phys. Plasmas 23, 082516 (2016); 27, 022507 (2020)], we show that the localization can be explained from the nonzero imaginary part of the binormal wavenumber. We further demonstrate that a localized surface-global eigenmode can be constructed from local gyrokinetic codes stella and GX, only if we first solve the local dispersion relation with real wavenumbers on each field line, and then do an analytic continuation to the complex-wavenumber plane. These results suggest that the complex-wavenumber spectra from surface-global effects are required to understand the linear drift-wave eigenmode structures in stellarators.",

    "abstract": "Achieving diffraction-limited resolution through atmospheric turbulence is a fundamental challenge for ground-based imaging systems, especially in the photon-starved regime. Conventional methods, such as adaptive optics and speckle imaging, struggle to achieve optimal performance when turbulence is severe and photons are limited. We present Turbulence-Aware Poisson Blind Deconvolution (TAP-BD), a framework designed for robust image recovery in these extreme conditions. TAP-BD exploits phase modulations on the incoming photons coupled with physics-informed optimization to extract more information from the available signal than traditional methods. Experimentally, our approach achieves a target PSNR of 24 dB with just tens of noisy measurements, under severe turbulence up to D/r0~24. This robust performance in photon-starved conditions unlocks new capabilities in space situational awareness and remote sensing.",

Positive ions landing on these oxides can further enhance local fields and drive Malter-like electron emission.

    "abstract": "Liquid nitrogen is commonly used in cryogenic applications and is a promising medium for the direct immersion cooling of sensors used for nuclear and particle physics experiments. The scintillation properties of gaseous nitrogen are well-documented, but little is known about the scintillation of liquid nitrogen. If present, scintillation light from interactions of ambient radioactivity could produce backgrounds for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter. Using a coincidence-tagged alpha decay, we demonstrate that liquid nitrogen exhibits measurable, albeit very faint, scintillation. Assuming the same scintillation wavelength spectrum as gaseous nitrogen, we estimate a relative scintillation yield of $Y_{\\text{LN}}/Y^{\\text{STP}}_{\\text{GN}} = 0.0142 \\pm 0.0005\\text{(stat)} \\pm 0.0030\\text{(sys)}$ with respect to gaseous nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure. Considering the average scintillation yield from alpha decays in gaseous nitrogen, this implies a scintillation yield for alpha decays in liquid nitrogen of $Y_{\\text{LN}} = 2.39 \\pm 0.56$ photons per MeV. To our knowledge this is the first measurement of scintillation in liquid nitrogen.",

Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\\alpha\\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field when the field is sufficiently strong. The work done by the Lorentz force is positive, so the magnetic field drives kinetic energy and not the other way around, as in a turbulent dynamo. This results in strong kinetic energy production and dissipation, which occurs at the expense of the magnetic energy. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.",

With a software-defined radio, our approach can dynamically sweep the synthetic wavelength and measure absolute optical range. We demonstrate this digital approach over a free-space optical delay line of 1 m and over an 40 km fiber link. The best obtained precision over the delay line is better than 60 nm (0.2 fs). Through a 40 km fiber spool, this precision degrades to 15 um (50 fs), which is a fractional error on the order of 2e-10 m/m. Our design is simple to implement, and only relies on continuous-wave interference, decreasing system complexity.",

    "abstract": "We propose a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detector, the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), optimized for the unexplored 0.1-10Hz band bridging the gap between the space-based LISA and future ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \\simeq 1 \\times 10^{-18}\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\\Omega_{\\rm GW} \\sim 3.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.",

    "title": "A DSMC-PIC coupling method for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system",
    "abstract": "We present a numerical framework for the simulation of collisional plasma dynamics, based on a coupling between Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system. The approach extends previously developed DSMC techniques for the homogeneous Landau equation to the fully inhomogeneous, electromagnetic regime. The Landau collision operator is treated through a stochastic particle formulation inspired by the grazing-collision limit of the Boltzmann equation, which enables an efficient and physically consistent representation of Coulomb interactions without relying on the full Boltzmann structure. The resulting collisional solver is combined, via operator splitting, with standard PIC schemes for the Vlasov-Maxwell dynamics, providing flexibility in the choice of field discretisation and time integration. The overall method preserves the main physical invariants of the system while maintaining computational efficiency and simplicity of implementation. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the coupled DSMC-PIC approach across a wide range of collisional regimes.",

    "title": "Revealing Liquid-Gas Transitions with Finite-Size Scaling in Confined   Systems",
    "abstract": "The application of an external field often renders empirical criteria for identifying liquid-gas phase transitions ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that the finite-size scaling of the density profile provides a definitive criterion to distinguish liquid-gas coexistence from a single fluid phase in field-confined systems. Our scaling method collapses the density profiles of different system sizes onto a single master curve for a one-phase system, while causing the profiles to intersect at the interface in a two-phase system. We validate this theoretical proposal through experiments and simulations of two model systems: colloidal suspensions under gravity and/or two-dimensional complex plasmas confined by a central potential. Our method is broadly applicable for detecting liquid-gas phase transitions in laboratory systems where external fields are inherent.",

    "title": "High-Harmonic Optical Vortex Generation from a Plasma Aperture",
    "abstract": "When a high-power, femtosecond, circularly polarized (CP) laser pulse is incident on a micrometer-scale aperture in a solid foil target, it drives surface plasma oscillation, generating high-order harmonic vortices in the diffracted light. However, this mechanism has so far only been studied theoretically under ideal conditions. In this work, we perform numerical studies on more realistic situations. In particular, we focus on a scenario where the laser is obliquely incident on the target surface to avoid the potential damage of the optics by the reflected light. We demonstrate that increasing oblique incidence angle, reducing target thickness, and improving laser contrast can enhance the harmonic conversion efficiency. However, the generated harmonic beams may contain both Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) (vortex) and non-LG components under non-ideal conditions. We show that they can be separated by their divergence, as the vortex components has smaller diverging angle. In addition, we have performed computational analyses on the harmonic divergence angles and topological charge spectra of vortex high-order harmonics under different conditions. These high-order harmonic pure LG modes can potentially be filtered out for wide range of fundamental and applied physics researches. This study provides valuable insights for the design and implementation of future experiments.",

    "title": "Quasi-Biennial Oscillations and Rieger-type Periodicities in a   Babcock-Leighton Solar Dynamo",
    "abstract": "The Sun's magnetic field shows the 11-year solar cycle and shorter periodicities, popularly known as the quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) and Rieger-type periods, or ``season of the Sun.\" Although several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of QBOs and Rieger-type periods, no single theory has widespread acceptance. We explore whether the \\bl\\ dynamo can produce Rieger-type periodicity and QBOs and investigate their underlying physical mechanisms. We use the observationally guided three-dimensional kinematic \\bl\\ dynamo model, which has emerged as a successful model for reproducing many characteristic features of the solar cycle. We use Morlet wavelet and global wavelet power spectrum techniques to analyze the data obtained from the model. In our model, we report QBOs and Rieger-type periods for the first time. Further, we investigate the individual \\bl\\ parameters (fluctuations in flux, latitude, time delay and tilt scatter) role in the occurrence of QBOs and Rieger-type periods. We find that while fluctuations in the individual parameters of the \\bl\\ process can produce QBOs and Rieger-type periodicity, their occurrence probability is enhanced when we consider combined fluctuations of all parameters in the \\bl\\ process. Finally, we find that with the increase of dynamo supercriticality, the model tends to suppress the generation of Rieger-type periodicity. Thus, this result supports earlier studies that suggest the solar dynamo is not highly supercritical.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a suppression of the light shift in a Coherent-Population-Trapping (CPT) atomic magnetometer by using linearly polarized light and a differential measurement between magnetic resonances. The radio frequency that creates the optical sidebands for CPT quickly switches between two magnetic sensitive transitions and the magnetic field is extrapolated from the difference of the center frequencies of the magnetic resonances. Light shifts and common drifts like collisional shifts can be suppressed through careful choice of measured resonances and we show the light shift reduction by more than a factor of 20 compared to excitation with circular polarized light. Various limitations to the method are discussed.",

    "title": "Kappa distributions in the framework of superstatistics",
    "abstract": "The kappa distribution of velocities appears routinely in the study of collisionless plasmas present in Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind among other contexts where particles are unable to reach thermal equilibrium. Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics, nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions. Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations, temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.",

    "title": "Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T) for Particle Jet Tagging",
    "abstract": "Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks, SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset (ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at https://github.com/aaronw5/SAL-T4HEP.",

    "title": "Constructing Field Aligned Coordinate Systems for Gyrokinetic   Simulations of Tokamaks in X-point Geometries",
    "abstract": "Structures in tokamak plasmas are elongated along the direction of the magnetic field and short in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. Many tokamak simulation codes take advantage of this by using a field aligned coordinate system. However, field aligned coordinate systems have a coordinate singularity at magnetic X-points where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes, which makes it difficult to use field aligned coordinate systems when simulating the core and scrape-off layer (SOL) simultaneously. Here we present an algorithm for computing geometric quantities in a standard field aligned coordinate system that avoids the singularity and allows one to conduct 2D axisymmetric simulations in X-point geometries. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm with an example simulation of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP).",
