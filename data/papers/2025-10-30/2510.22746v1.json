  "title": "Scintillation of liquid nitrogen",
  "abstract": "Liquid nitrogen is commonly used in cryogenic applications and is a promising medium for the direct immersion cooling of sensors used for nuclear and particle physics experiments. The scintillation properties of gaseous nitrogen are well-documented, but little is known about the scintillation of liquid nitrogen. If present, scintillation light from interactions of ambient radioactivity could produce backgrounds for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter. Using a coincidence-tagged alpha decay, we demonstrate that liquid nitrogen exhibits measurable, albeit very faint, scintillation. Assuming the same scintillation wavelength spectrum as gaseous nitrogen, we estimate a relative scintillation yield of $Y_{\\text{LN}}/Y^{\\text{STP}}_{\\text{GN}} = 0.0142 \\pm 0.0005\\text{(stat)} \\pm 0.0030\\text{(sys)}$ with respect to gaseous nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure. Considering the average scintillation yield from alpha decays in gaseous nitrogen, this implies a scintillation yield for alpha decays in liquid nitrogen of $Y_{\\text{LN}} = 2.39 \\pm 0.56$ photons per MeV. To our knowledge this is the first measurement of scintillation in liquid nitrogen.",
