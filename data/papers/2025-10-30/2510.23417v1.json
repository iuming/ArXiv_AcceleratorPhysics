  "title": "Filling the Gap: Atom Probe Tomography of Porous Structures Enabled by   Site Specific SEMGlu Curing",
  "abstract": "Porous microstructures, while central to many functional materials, remain difficult to characterize quantitatively by atom probe tomography (APT). Although several strategies have been proposed over the past decade, most remain constrained by significant practical or technical limitations. Here, we introduce an in situ pore filling approach that integrates seamlessly into conventional specimen preparation workflows. The method employs a vacuum compatible resin that is rapidly cured by the electron beam during standard ion beam based preparation, eliminating the need for additional instrumentation or extensive sample handling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a porous SnSe + MXene electrode, a material system otherwise difficult to analyze via APT characterisation. This method offers a robust, accessible solution for extending APT analysis to porous materials",
