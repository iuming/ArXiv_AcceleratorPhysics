  "title": "Search for Invisible Decay Modes in Nuclear Gamma Cascades of a   ${}^{46}$Sc Source Using a CsI (Tl) Detector",
  "abstract": "Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in modern physics, motivating extensive searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\\gamma$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\\&M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a \"missing gamma\" technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance--disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range. This result highlights the sensitivity of the missing-gamma technique and motivates the development of a larger-scale detector with improved systematic control to extend dark-sector searches into previously unexplored regions of parameter space.",
