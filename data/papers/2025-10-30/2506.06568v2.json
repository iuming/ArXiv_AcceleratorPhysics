  "title": "Removal of spallation-induced tritium from silicon through diffusion",
  "abstract": "Tritium, predominantly produced through spallation reactions caused by cosmic ray interactions, is a significant radioactive background for silicon-based rare event detection experiments, such as dark matter searches. We have investigated the feasibility of removing cosmogenic tritium from high-purity silicon intended for use in low-background experiments. We demonstrate that significant tritium removal is possible through diffusion by subjecting silicon to high-temperature (> 400C) baking. Using an analytical model for the de-trapping and diffusion of tritium in silicon, our measurements indicate that cosmogenic tritium diffusion constants are comparable to previous measurements of thermally-introduced tritium, with complete de-trapping and removal achievable above 750C. This approach has the potential to alleviate the stringent constraints of cosmic ray exposure prior to device fabrication and significantly reduce the cosmogenic tritium backgrounds of silicon-based detectors for next-generation rare event searches.",
