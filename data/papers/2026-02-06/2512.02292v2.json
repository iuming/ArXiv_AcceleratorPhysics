  "title": "Solitary Alfvén Waves",
  "abstract": "We present the solitary Alfvén wave, an exact nonlinear solution of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, and construct a three-dimensional numerical model -- an \\emph{Alfvénon}. The model is characterized by an unperturbed far field, quasi-constant $|\\boldsymbol{B}|$, and open field-line topology. Direct MHD simulations of the Alfvénon demonstrate remarkable stability, confirming that it behaves as a nonlinear solitary Alfvénic solution under ideal MHD evolution.",
