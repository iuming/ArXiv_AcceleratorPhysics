  "title": "Improved Fluid Modeling of Space Debris Generated Ion-Acoustic Precursor Solitons",
  "abstract": "This study reexamines the excitation of ion-acoustic precursor solitons by a supersonically moving charged debris object, incorporating two previously overlooked physical factors: the dynamic charging of the debris and the impermeable nature of its surface. The influence of charging dynamics is explored using an enhanced one-dimensional fluid-Poisson model, where the source charge is treated as a dynamical variable and solved self-consistently alongside the core plasma equations. By comparing these results with prior fixed-charge models, we evaluate the effects on soliton onset and propagation, finding that charging dynamics does not hinder soliton generation or evolution. To assess the impact of the impermeability of debris surface, a two-dimensional fluid model simulates the interaction between an electrostatically biased, impenetrable object and a flowing plasma. Modeling the object as an infinite wall disconnects the upstream and downstream plasma regions, forming a sheath without solitons -- consistent with earlier fluid and particle-in-cell simulations. However, replacing the wall with a finite object enables plasma flow around it, restoring upstream-downstream connectivity and naturally generating precursor solitons.",
