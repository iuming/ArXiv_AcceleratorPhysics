  "title": "High-intensity LINACS: Dynamics, Instabilities and Mitigations",
  "abstract": "In this lecture we discuss the intensity limitations in hadron LINACs. First, we will detail what are the two main meanings of intensity limitations as they differ substantially between high power LINACs and high brightness LINACs. Then we will illustrate in detail the building blocks of hadron linacs focusing on the beam dynamics. We will conclude with few examples of intensity limitations and their mitigations.",
