  "title": "Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems",
  "abstract": "A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.",
