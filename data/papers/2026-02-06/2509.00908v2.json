  "title": "Beam test results of the Intermediate Silicon Tracker for sPHENIX",
  "abstract": "The Intermediate Silicon Tracker (INTT), a two-layer barrel silicon strip tracker, is a key component of the tracking system for sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The INTT is designed to enable the association of reconstructed tracks with individual RHIC bunch crossings. To evaluate the performance of preproduction INTT ladders and the readout chain, a beam test was conducted at the Research Center for Accelerator and Radioisotope Science, Tohoku University, Japan. This paper presents the performance of the INTT evaluated through studies of the signal-to-noise ratio, residual distribution, spatial resolution, hit-detection efficiency, and multiple track reconstruction.",
