  "title": "Evaluation of CZT Detector Performance in Alpha and Gamma Spectrometry",
  "abstract": "The present work reports on the performance studies of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) planar detector structures. To better understand the correlation between the physical properties and the electrical and spectroscopic behavior of the devices, we carried out current-voltage (IV) and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, in addition to gamma- and alpha-spectroscopy. For each tested sensor, spectroscopic responses were recorded under varying applied bias voltage. The described suite of measurements provides the parameters needed to evaluate bulk resistivity, signal efficiency, and energy resolution for characteristic peaks at different energies. Readout configurations and data processing are discussed in related sections.",
