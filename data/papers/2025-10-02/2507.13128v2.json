  "title": "Phase noise measurement of semiconductor optical amplifiers",
  "abstract": "We introduce a novel measurement method for the phase noise measurement of optical amplifiers, topologically similar to the Heterodyne Mach-Zehnder Interferometer but governed by different principles, and we report on the measurement of a fibered amplifier at 1.55 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ wavelength. The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup. This sets an upper bound of the amplifier noise at $-32$ $\\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=1$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds to a frequency stability of $5.2{\\times}10^{-17}/\\tau$ (Allan deviation), where $\\tau$ is the integration time. Such noise level is lower than that of most Fabry-Perot cavity-stabilized lasers. These results are of interest in a wide range of applications including metrology, instrumentation, optical communications, or fiber links.",
