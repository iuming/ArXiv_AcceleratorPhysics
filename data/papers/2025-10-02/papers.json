    "title": "Scintillating properties of Cs${_2}$ZrCl${_6}$ crystals in the   temperature range of 5-300 K",
    "abstract": "A new comprehensive study on the Cs${_2}$ZrCl${_6}$ (CZC) crystal scintillating properties under different types of irradiation was performed over a wide temperature range from 5 to 300 K. The light yield (LY) at room temperature (RT), measured under irradiation by 662 keV $\\gamma$ quanta of $^{137}$Cs, was evaluated to be 53,300$\\pm$4,700 photons/MeV corresponding to approximately 71% of its estimated absolute value. The maximum light emission was observed in the temperature interval 135-165 K, where the LY reached 56,900 photons/MeV and 19,700 photons/MeV for $\\gamma$ quanta and $\\alpha$ particles, respectively. The quenching factor (QF) for $\\alpha$ particles increases smoothly from QF = 0.30 at RT to QF = 0.36 at 135 K. The shape of scintillation pulses induced by $\\alpha$ particles is characterized by three time-constants (0.3, 2.5 and 11.8 $\\mu$s at RT), whereas the average pulse of $\\gamma$ induced events is characterized by two time-constants (1.3 and 11.5 $\\mu$s at RT). At the same time, scintillating properties and pulse-shape discrimination capability of the CZC exhibit an acute deterioration at temperatures below 135 K. The optimal operating conditions to maximize the scintillating performance of undoped CZC crystals are discussed.",

This chapter reviews the concepts of GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and describes their operating principles, data acquisition and analysis techniques, and some of the methods used to extract source properties. The scientific impact of GW observations is discussed as well, including contributions to astrophysics, tests of general relativity, and cosmology.

    "title": "Precision measurement and modelling of the threshold-free 210Pb β   spectrum",
    "abstract": "Beta decay is a fundamental process that governs nuclear stability and serves as a sensitive probe of the weak interaction and possible physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. However, precise measurements of complete $\\beta$ decay spectra, particularly at low energies, remain experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here we report a high-precision, threshold-free measurement of the full $\\beta$ decay spectrum of 210Pb to excited states of 210Bi, using a transition-edge sensor (TES)-based micro-calorimeter. This approach enables the detection of $\\beta$ particle energies from 0 keV up to their endpoint by coincidence summing with subsequent de-excitation energy, thereby eliminating reconstruction artifacts near zero energy that have traditionally limited low-energy spectral accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first complete, high-precision $\\beta$ decay spectrum from 0 keV. The data resolve theoretical uncertainties associated with the atomic quantum exchange (AQE) effect. An accompanying ab initio theoretical framework, incorporating atomic, leptonic, and nuclear components, predicts a statistically significant (7.2 {$\\sigma$}) enhancement in $\\beta$ emission probability near zero energy, in agreement with the measurement and in contrast to models that omit AQE corrections. These results provide a new benchmark for $\\beta$ decay theory at low energies, deepen our understanding of the weak interaction, and establish a critical foundation for searches for new physics, including dark matter interactions and precision studies of neutrinos.",

    "title": "Silicon pinhole strip defects and their impact on ATLAS Inner Tracker HV   current measurement",
    "abstract": "In preparation for the High-Luminsoity LHC (HL-LHC), the ATLAS detector will undergo major detector upgrades, including the replacement of the current Inner Detector with the new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk). The ITk consists of a pixel detector close to the beamline surrounded by a large-area strip detector. During detector production, the electrical properties of silicon sensors and readout electronics must be characterized through a series of quality control (QC) and quality assurance tests. These tests ensure any defect is captured at the earliest possible stage. One such defect, called a pinhole, occurs when the strip implant and the metal readout electrode are shorted through the intermediary dielectric layer. Notably, the introduction of pinholes during module assembly and pinhole effects on completed modules, especially on leakage current measurement circuitry, have never been studied. In this paper, we investigate the effect of such connections on the sensor leakage current measurements of completed modules and introduce new ways to locate pinholed strips. With minor modifications to testing procedures, such defects are shown not to impede module testing or performance.",

We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.",

    "title": "Design and Evaluation of CZT-based Micro-activity Dose Calibrator for   TAT Application using Monte Carlo Simulation",
    "abstract": "A novel CZT-based micro-activity dose calibrator has been designed via Monte Carlo simulation (GATE) to accurately measure low-level activity 225Ac for targeted alpha therapy (TAT) application. Because even small overdoses in TAT can induce severe local toxicity, activities in the microcurie down to nanocurie regime are often required, and accurate activity measurement by dose calibrators is a priori to safe and effective treatment. Standard dose calibrators, or high-pressurized gas-filled ionization chambers, are not suitable in this range due to limited sensitivity and lack of energy discrimination. To address this, we designed a CZT-based micro-activity calibrator that (i) adopts a box-shaped well geometry to obtain higher solid-angle coverage and (ii) applies time-coincident pixel-level clustering to recover full-energy-peak net counts otherwise lost to multi-site Compton scattering. Using GATE, serial dilutions from 1.0 uCi down to 1e-6 uCi were simulated, activities were reconstructed from the 218 and 440 keV gamma peaks and performance was compared against a NaI(Tl) well counter, which serves as an alternative to standard dose calibrator. Across six orders of magnitude, the CZT-based micro-activity dose calibrator exhibited near-unity linearity (slope m=0.9934) with percent-level bias, whereas the NaI(Tl) counter showed systematic under-response under identical conditions. These results indicate that a CZT-based approach can provide accurate low-activity quantification for TAT, motivating forthcoming hardware validation.",

    "abstract": "A compact gamma-ray detector module was developed and characterized for spectroscopic applications across a wide energy range. The detector comprises a 4x4 array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs, Hamamatsu MPPC S13360-3050) coupled with three different inorganic scintillators (YSO, GaGG, BGO). The performance of the detector was evaluated over an energy range from 32 keV to 2500 keV using various standard gamma-ray point sources ({241}Am, {137}Cs, {22}Na, {60}Co, {228}Th). All three detector configurations demonstrated linearity between pulse height and gamma-ray energy over most of the tested range. GAGG exhibited the most consistent linear behavior up to 2500 keV. YSO with a faster decay constant showed linearity up to ~2000 keV, followed by slight saturation effects likely due to SiPM microcell occupancy limits at higher photon flux. BGO, characterized by a low light output and longer decay time, demonstrated stable linearity up to 2500 keV but reduced sensitivity below 300 keV. The measured energy resolution at 662 keV was 8.17% for GAGG, 9.3% for YSO, and 10.2% for BGO, consistent with their light yield and photon detection efficiency (PDE) - matching characteristics. The obtained results showed the trade-offs between scintillator materials in terms of energy resolution, dynamic range, and linearity, and confirm the suitability of the tested configurations for compact gamma-ray spectroscopy applications across the studied energy range.",

    "abstract": "Achieving tritium self-sufficiency is a critical challenge for future fusion power plants. The BABY 1L experiment, part of the LIBRA project at MIT, aims to benchmark tritium breeding and release in molten salt breeder systems under deuterium-tritium (DT) neutron irradiation. Building on the initial \\SI{100}{mL} campaign, BABY 1L introduces a tenfold increase in breeder volume, improved thermal and gas handling systems, and enhanced neutron diagnostics, including a proton recoil telescope. We report on results from four irradiation experiments using sealed-tube DT neutron generators, with tritium collected by water bubblers measured via liquid scintillation counting. Experimentally determined Tritium Breeding Ratios (TBRs) were compared to OpenMC neutronics simulations, showing very good agreement. The measured TBR values demonstrate a six-fold improvement over the \\SI{100}{mL} experiments, largely attributed to the increased solid angle and improved measurement fidelity. We also investigate tritium release dynamics and identify diffusion-limited transport as the dominant regime in the salt volume in the temperature range 630-750 \\si{\\celsius}. Additionally, we observe that the introduction of hydrogen in the helium carrier gas significantly accelerates tritium release, consistent with an isotopic exchange mechanism. All analysis is conducted through the open-source \\texttt{libra-toolbox} \\cite{libra-toolbox}, which streamlines simulation, data processing, and validation across experimental campaigns. These results provide critical insights into the design and operation of future liquid breeder systems and demonstrate the maturity of the BABY platform as a testbed for tritium breeding studies.",

The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup. This sets an upper bound of the amplifier noise at $-32$ $\\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=1$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds to a frequency stability of $5.2{\\times}10^{-17}/\\tau$ (Allan deviation), where $\\tau$ is the integration time.

    "title": "Enhancing Particle Identification in Helium-Based Drift Chambers Using   Cluster Counting Insights from Beam Test Studies",
    "abstract": "Particle identification in gaseous detectors traditionally relies on energy loss measurements (dE/dx); however, uncertainties in total energy deposition limit its resolution. The cluster counting technique (dN/dx) offers an alternative approach by exploiting the Poisson-distributed nature of primary ionization, providing a statistically robust method for mass determination. Simulation studies with Garfield++ and Geant4 indicate that dN/dx can achieve twice the resolution of dE/dx in helium-based drift chambers. However, experimental implementation is challenging due to signal overlap in the time domain, complicating the identification of electron peaks and ionization clusters. This paper presents novel algorithms and modern computational techniques to address these challenges, facilitating accurate cluster recognition in experimental data. The effectiveness of these algorithms is validated through four beam tests conducted at CERN, utilizing various helium gas mixtures, gas gains, and wire orientations relative to ionizing tracks. The experiments employ a muon beam (1 GeV/c to 180 GeV/c) with drift tubes of different sizes and sense wire diameters. The analysis explores the Poisson nature of cluster formation, evaluates the performance of different clustering algorithms, and examines the dependence of counting efficiency on the beam particle impact parameter. Furthermore, a comparative study of the resolution achieved using dN/dx and dE/dx is presented.",

    "title": "All-Optical Generation of Dense, Multi-GeV, Longitudinally-Polarized   Positron Beams",
    "abstract": "The production of high-yield, longitudinally polarized positron beams represents an outstanding challenge in advanced accelerator science. Laser-driven schemes offer a compact alternative but typically yield only transverse polarization, or require pre-polarized electron beams, and struggle to efficiently accelerate positrons to high energies. Here, we introduce an all-optical scheme that overcomes these limitations by integrating positron generation, acceleration, and spin manipulation in a unified framework. Through a head-on collision between an ultraintense, circularly polarized laser pulse and a counterpropagating unpolarized electron beam, we drive a robust QED cascade. The nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process within the cascade produces positrons that are born directly within the strong laser field. Crucially, these positrons are instantaneously captured and accelerated to multi-GeV energies (up to $\\sim$9 GeV) via a direct laser acceleration mechanism, while their spins are simultaneously rotated to longitudinal alignment by the field dynamics. Our Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the simultaneous achievement of a high positron yield ($\\sim$20 $e^+/e^-$), a high average longitudinal polarization ($\\sim$50\\%), and GeV-scale energies. This all-optical source, feasible at upcoming ultraintense laser facilities, presents a compact and efficient solution for applications in collider physics and fundamental high-energy experiments.",

It has successfully demonstrated several key design elements of FCC-ee. The design luminosity has not yet been reached, however.

In this note we review the accomplishments, challenges and obstacles of SuperKEKB, and compare these with the FCC-ee design.",

    "title": "Omnigenous umbilic stellarators",
    "abstract": "To better understand the dependence of the magnetic field structure in the plasma edge on the plasma boundary shape, in the context of X-point and island divertor designs, we define and develop a class of stellarators called umbilic stellarators. These equilibria are characterized by a single continuous high-curvature edge on the plasma boundary that goes around multiple times toroidally before meeting itself. We develop a technique that allows us to simultaneously optimize the plasma boundary along with a curve lying on the boundary on which we impose a high curvature while imposing omnigenity -- a property of the magnetic field that ensures trapped particle confinement throughout the plasma volume. We find that umbilic stellarators naturally tend to favor piecewise omnigenity instead of omnigenity with a specific helicity. After generating omnigenous umbilic stellarators, we design coil sets for some of them and explore the field line structure in the edge and its sensitivity to small fluctuations in the plasma. Finally, using single-stage optimization, we simultaneously modify the plasma and coil shape and propose an experiment to modify an existing tokamak to a finite-beta stellarator using this technique and explore a potentially simpler way to convert a limited tokamak into a diverted stellarator.",

    "title": "Measuring dark currents in multiple cryogenic SiPMs with sub-pA   sensitivity using an automated IV multiplexer",
    "abstract": "We present the design of an automated current-voltage (IV) multiplexer (MUX) that enables accurate measurement of the dark current in cryogenic silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), achieving a sensitivity equivalent to detecting less than one avalanche per second. Dynamic pulse-counting measurements were used as a benchmark for reconstructing the dark current in static IV measurements. The IV-MUX features 15 channels on a single board and up to seven boards can be connected in parallel under the control of one Arduino microcontroller. To minimize leakage and enhance performance, the layout includes guard rings and high-isolation relays, enabling resolution of currents as small as 49 fA. The IV-MUX can be integrated into systems designed for IV or pulse-counting measurements, enabling seamless switching between IV and pulse-counting modes. Moreover, the IV-MUX is vacuum-compatible, validated by testing an SiPM array in a cryostat. This feature reduces the need for multiple feedthroughs when testing sensor arrays in vacuum. The design is open source and can be used to facilitate rapid and automated testing of SiPMs or similar low-current devices in one measurement cycle.",

    "title": "Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark   matter halos: origin of the NFW profile",
    "abstract": "Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius, if it is initially shallower than $r^{-1}$. This is fundamentally a consequence of the virial theorem: self-gravitating systems have a negative specific heat and want to cool down when energized. The inner halo relaxes to an $r^{-1}$ cusp because its central region is the coldest among all $r^{-\\gamma}$ profiles with $0\\leq \\gamma \\leq 2$. Accretion and relaxation in the $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ outer fall-off, thereby establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. We demonstrate for the first time that this profile emerges as a steady state solution to the problem of self-consistent collisionless relaxation.",

    "title": "A Linear Collider Vision for the Future of Particle Physics",
    "abstract": "In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\\&D facilities as part of a linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer, independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\\&D for advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals, early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the context of CLIC and ILC.",

    "abstract": "A Kinetic Inductance Phonon-Mediated Detector is a calorimeter that uses kinetic inductance detectors to read out phonon signals from the device substrate. We have established a consortium comprising university and national lab groups dedicated to advancing the state of the art in these detectors, with the ultimate goal of designing a detector sub-eV threshold on energy deposited in the substrate, enabling searches for both light dark matter and low-energy neutrino interactions. This consortium brings together experts in kinetic inductance detector design, phonon and quasiparticle dynamics, and noise modeling, along with specialized fabrication facilities, test platforms, and unique calibration capabilities. Recently, our consortium has demonstrated a resolution on energy absorbed by the sensor of 2.1 eV, the current record for such devices. The current focus of the consortium is modeling and improving the phonon collection efficiency and implementing low-$\\boldsymbol{T_c}$ superconductors, both of which serve to improve the overall energy resolution and threshold of the detectors.",

    "abstract": "We present first-principles numerical calculations of the depolarization rate of spin-polarized deuterium and tritium nuclei in realistic tokamak plasmas, driven by resonant interactions with plasma waves. Backed up by first-of-a-kind linear and nonlinear simulations, we find that alpha particle-driven Alfv\\'enic modes cause only negligible depolarization, which is contrary to expectations in prior literature. Other Alfv\\'enic instabilities can in principle degrade polarization, but only under conditions unlikely to be realized on transport timescales. By combining full-orbit particle tracing with a dedicated depolarization solver, we demonstrate that wave-driven depolarization is surprisingly weak in SPARC and ITER-scale devices. These results provide strong evidence that spin-polarized fuel can maintain its polarization long enough to boost fusion reactivity, opening a viable path toward substantially enhanced performance in magnetic confinement fusion power plants.",

    "title": "Most stringent bound on electron neutrino mass obtained with a scalable   low temperature microcalorimeter array",
    "abstract": "The determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale remains a fundamental open question in particle physics, with profound implications for both the Standard Model and cosmology. Direct kinematic measurements, independent of model-dependent assumptions, provide the most robust approach to address this challenge. In this Letter, we present the most stringent upper bound on the effective electron neutrino mass ever obtained with a calorimetric measurement of the electron capture decay of $^{163}$Ho. The HOLMES experiment employs an array of ion-implanted transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters, achieving an average energy resolution of 6 eV FWHM with a scalable, multiplexed readout technique. With a total of $7\\times10^7$ decay events recorded over two months and a Bayesian statistical analysis, we derive an upper limit of $m_{\\beta}<27$ eV/c$^2$ at 90% credibility. These results validate the feasibility of $^{163}$Ho calorimetry for next-generation neutrino mass experiments and demonstrate the potential of a scalable TES-based microcalorimetric technique to push the sensitivity of direct neutrino mass measurements beyond the current state of the art.",

    "title": "Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and   Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications",
    "abstract": "Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.",

Using calibrated polarizations and wavefront tilts we construct a measurement matrix capable of reconstructing both the Stokes parameters and the wavefront, yielding a measurement of wavefront gradients as small as 100 $\\mu$rad with a polarimetric angular error of approximately 0.1 radians on the Poincar\\'e sphere in a single frame measurement.",

    "abstract": "Scale invariance is a hallmark of many natural systems, including solar flares, where energy release spans a vast range of scales. Recent computational advances, at the level of both algorithmics and hardware, have enabled high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to span multiple scales, offering new insights into magnetic energy dissipation processes. Here, we study scale invariance of magnetic energy dissipation in two distinct MHD simulations. Current sheets are identified and analyzed over time. Results demonstrate that dissipative events exhibit scale invariance, with power-law distributions characterizing their energy dissipation and lifetimes. Remarkably, these distributions are consistent across the two simulations, despite differing numerical and physical setups, suggesting universality in the process of magnetic energy dissipation. Comparisons between the evolution of dissipation regions reveals distinct growth behaviors in high plasma-beta regions (convective zone) and low plasma-beta regions (atmosphere). The latter display spatiotemporal dynamics similar to those of avalanche models, suggesting self-organized criticality and a common universality class.",

    "abstract": "Positronium Lifetime Imaging (PLI), an emerging extension of conventional positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, offers a novel window for probing the submolecular properties of biological tissues by imaging the mean lifetime of the positronium atom. Currently, the method is under rapid development in terms of reconstruction and detection systems. Recently, the first in vivo PLI of the human brain was performed using the J-PET scanner utilizing the $^{68}$Ga isotope. However, this isotope has limitations due to its comparatively low prompt gamma yields, which is crucial for positronium lifetime measurement. Among alternative radionuclides, $^{44}$Sc stands out as a promising isotope for PLI, characterized by a clinically suitable half-life (4.04 hours) emitting 1157 keV prompt gamma in 100% cases after the emission of the positron. This study reports the first experimental demonstration of PLI with $^{44}$Sc, carried out on a NEMA-Image Quality (IQ) phantom using the Modular J-PET tomograph-the first plastic scintillators-based PET scanner.",

    "title": "The CMS Phase-2 Fast Beam Condition Monitor prototype test with beam",
    "abstract": "The Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM) is a standalone luminometer for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program of the CMS Experiment at CERN. The detector is under development and features a new, radiation-hard, front-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for beam monitoring applications. The achieved timing resolution of a few nanoseconds enables the measurement of both the luminosity and the beam-induced background. The ASIC, called FBCM23, features six channels with adjustable shaping times, enabling in-field fine-tuning. Each ASIC channel outputs a single binary asynchronous signal encoding time of arrival and time over threshold information. The FBCM is based on silicon-pad sensors, with two sensor designs presently being considered. This paper presents the results of tests of the FBCM detector prototype using both types of silicon sensors with hadron, muon, and electron beams. Irradiated FBCM23 ASICs and silicon-pad sensors were also tested to simulate the expected conditions near the end of the detector's lifetime in the HL-LHC radiation environment. Based on test results, direct bonding between the sensor and ASIC was chosen, and an optimal bias voltage and ASIC threshold for FBCM operation were proposed. The current design of the front-end test board was validated following the beam test and is now being used for the first front-end module, which is expected to be produced in summer 2025. These results represent a major step forward in validating the FBCM concept, first version of the firmware and establishing a reliable design path for the final detector.",

    "title": "Measurement of the Liquid Argon Scintillation Pulse Shape Using   Differentiable Simulation in the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills Experiment",
    "abstract": "The Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment is a liquid argon (LAr) light collection detector searching for MeV-scale neutrino and Beyond Standard Model physics signatures. Two hundred 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) instrument the 7 ton fiducial volume with 50% photocathode coverage to detect light produced by charged particles. CCM's light-based approach reduces requirements of LAr purity, compared to other detection technologies, such that sub-MeV particles can be reliably detected without additional LAr filtration and with O(1) parts-per-million of common contaminants. We present a measurement of LAr light production and propagation parameters, with uncertainties, obtained from a sample of MeV-scale electromagnetic events. The optimization of this high-dimensional parameter space was facilitated by a differentiable optical photon Monte-Carlo simulation, and detailed PMT response characterization. This result accurately predicts the timing and spatial distribution of light due to scintillation and Cherenkov emission in the detector. This is the first description of photon propagation in LAr to include several effects, including: anomalous dispersion of the index of refraction near the ultraviolet resonance, Mie scattering from impurities, and Cherenkov light production.",

    "abstract": "This Letter reports the event-by-event observation of Cherenkov light from sub-MeV electrons in a high scintillation light-yield liquid argon (LAr) detector by the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment. The CCM200 detector, located at Los Alamos National Laboratory, instruments 7 tons (fiducial volume) of LAr with 200 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 80% of which are coated in a wavelength shifting material and the remaining 20% are uncoated. In the prompt time region of an event, defined as $-6 \\leq t < 0$ ns relative to the event start time $t=0$, the uncoated PMTs are primarily sensitive to visible Cherenkov photons. Using gamma-rays from a $^{22}$Na source for production of sub-MeV electrons, we isolated prompt Cherenkov light with $>5\\sigma$ confidence and developed a selection to obtain a low-background electromagnetic sample. This is the first event-by-event observation of Cherenkov photons from sub-MeV electrons in a high-yield scintillator detector, and represents a milestone in low-energy particle detector development.",

    "abstract": "Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is the next-generation flagship space observatory for high-energy gamma-ray detection proposed by China. The observation energy range covers from MeV to TeV and beyond, with acceptance of 10 m^2sr. The calorimeter serves as a crucial subdetector of VLAST, responsible for high-precision energy measurement and electron/proton discrimination. This discrimination capability is essential for accurately identifying gamma-ray events among the background of charged particles. To accommodate such an extensive energy range, a high dynamic range readout scheme employing dual avalanche photodiodes (APDs) has been developed, achieving a remarkable dynamic range of 10^6. Furthermore, a high granular prototype based on bismuth germanate (BGO) cubic scintillation crystals has been developed. This high granularity enables detailed imaging of the particle showers, improving both energy resolution and particle identification. The prototype's performance is evaluated through cosmic ray testing, providing valuable data for optimizing the final calorimeter design for VLAST.",

    "abstract": "Laser-accelerated electron bunches and the secondary radiation sources they produce exhibit unique temporal resolution for probing ultrafast physical processes due to their ultrashort pulse duration. The inherently short temporal profile of these pulses leads to extremely high peak bunch currents, thereby enabling a wide range of practical applications. In this study, we propose an innovative method for generating such bunch by utilizing high-harmonics generated through laser-plasma interaction as the driving pulse, which subsequently interacts with a thin target to produce an attosecond electron bunch. Using this method, we successfully generated an electron bunch characterized by excellent collimation and an ultra-short duration of approximately 100 attoseconds, representing a substantial reduction in bunch duration. The total bunch charge achieved was 0.38 nC, with an emittance of $4.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{mm} \\cdot \\text{mrad}$ and a divergence angle of approximately $10^\\circ$. Moreover, by systematically analyzing the effects of laser intensity and target positioning, we determined an optimized set of simulation parameters. This research establishes a robust foundation for the generation of ultrashort electron bunches and opens new prospects for their application in advanced high-energy and attosecond physics experiments.",

    "abstract": "The transition toward renewable, fiber-based packaging requires an improved understanding of chemical modifications in high-yield pulps such as chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the energy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory methods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the fiber level, which can be visualized using $\\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present a laboratory $\\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its capability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets. A 32 $\\times$ 32 point grid scan (1.6-1.6 mm$^2$ field of view, 50 $\\mu$m step, 300 s/point) successfully resolved sulfur K$\\alpha$ (2.31 keV) and calcium K$\\alpha$ (3.69 keV) fluorescence without helium flushing. Comparative measurements at the Elettra synchrotron confirmed consistency of sulfur peak position and spatial distribution, with higher spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Histogram analysis using Wasserstein distance metrics demonstrated close agreement between datasets despite differing acquisition conditions. These results demonstrate that laboratory XRF can reproducibly detect and map sulfur in CTMP fibers under ambient conditions, providing a practical tool to complement synchrotron studies and supporting the development of energy-efficient, fiber-based packaging materials.",

Using gyrokinetic simulations of a linearly stable tearing mode in a large-aspect-ratio toroidal geometry under collisionless conditions, we demonstrate that micro-instabilities generate an $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ flow that drives magnetic field line reconnection. This process forms multiple small-scale islands along the resonant surface, which interact nonlinearly and eventually coalesce into large-scale magnetic islands. These islands are capable of significantly flattening the equilibrium profile across the island O-points and thus acting as a seed for their further neoclassical growth. Notably, the mechanism operates independently of the parity of the destabilizing micro-instability.",

Here, we present a magnetless isolator that overcomes these limitations with simulated performances on par with the state-of-the-art. Using a dispersion-engineered transmission line with a propagating adiabatic flux modulation, the simulated device achieves more than 20 dB isolation over a broad frequency band ranging from 4 to 8 GHz, which can be modified based on the device parameters.

    "abstract": "The effect of the selenium concentration in the composition of the $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ semiconductor crystals on their etching with a bromine-methanol solution was studied. A thermodynamic model is proposed to describe the degree of etching of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ and $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals. A thermodynamic law is obtained for the first time to describe the change in the etching rate of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals with different selenium concentrations. Experimental dependencies are constructed for etching trajectories and etching rates with 5% bromine-methanol solutions of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystal samples with nominal $x\\sim 0.1$ and selenium concentrations of $y=0$, $y=0.02$, $y=0.06$, and $y=0.1$. The average etching rates were 24${\\mu }$m/min, 18${\\mu }$m/min, 15${\\mu }$m/min, and 13${\\mu }$m/min. The threshold effect of a strong decrease in the etching rate upon transition from ternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ to quaternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals, associated with hardening of the crystal structure, is identify and theoretically explained.

    "title": "Flow Crossover and Parallel Outflow during Collisionless Magnetic   Reconnection",
    "abstract": "Using particle-in-cell simulations that label ions and electrons according to their initial inflow region, we find that during 2D collisionless magnetic reconnection, the bulk flow of the plasma from each inflow side crosses paths with plasma from the other inflow side and crosses the midplane before being redirected into an outflow jet. This feature, which we term ``flow crossover,'' implies mechanisms to generate bulk motion in a direction parallel to the magnetic field. We find that ions and electrons undergo different parallel driving mechanisms, leading to different flow crossover patterns. The parallel bulk flow for ions is generated more locally within the ion diffusion region, whereas the parallel bulk flow for electrons is mostly generated outside the electron diffusion region. Consequently, the reconnection outflows are more of a parallel flow than a perpendicular flow, especially for the electron outflow. The flow crossover and the parallel outflow patterns occur not only in symmetric reconnection but also in the more complex scenario of a guide-field asymmetric reconnection, suggesting that it is a general feature of collisionless magnetic reconnection. Because the plasma on one side of the outflow mostly originates from the inflow plasma on the other side, we predict that near an asymmetric reconnection site in a collisionless space plasma, in situ observations across the outflow region could reveal locally reversed gradients in plasma properties.",

    "abstract": "Compressible turbulence governs energy transfer across scales in space and astrophysical systems. Capturing both the turbulence cascade and damping is therefore crucial for models of energy conversion, plasma heating, and particle transport in diverse plasma environments, but remains challenging. Progress is constrained by two unresolved fundamental questions: the persistence of the turbulence cascade in the presence of shocks and discontinuities, and the validity of classical wave theories under strong nonlinearity. In particular, it remains unclear whether meaningful cascade dynamics can be defined in compressible turbulence with phase steepening, and whether frameworks developed for monochromatic waves remain applicable to complex, broadband fluctuations. Using large-scale, high-resolution kinetic simulations, we analyze turbulence-particle interactions, which are beyond the capability of standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We show that compressible turbulence damping at MHD scales in quantitative agreement with transit-time damping theory, even in fully developed nonlinear states. Moreover, the cascade persists despite the generation of shocks and discontinuities due to phase steepening, revealing a surprising robustness of cross-scale energy transfer under extreme conditions. We further provide the spectral expression of compressible turbulence. These results close a long-standing gap in the physics of compressible turbulence and establish a robust foundation for turbulence modeling from the heliosphere to galaxies.",

    "abstract": "This study constructs a hybrid module with a multi-material collaborative detection architecture by integrating silicon pixel layers into the longitudinally segmented scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter module and optimizes the placement of the silicon layers. The module utilizes the pre-shower characteristics of the front-end scintillator units to ensure sufficient energy deposition in the silicon pixel layers, thereby maintaining its high-precision detection capability. A dedicated simulation framework combining Geant4 modeling for the scintillator section and a parameterized approach for the silicon pixel layer is employed for module verification and performance study. The hybrid module demonstrates overall performance enhancement. The maximum achievable improvements are 56% for position resolution and 26% for time resolution, respectively. These advancements also lead to significant increase of physics sensitivity, especially for physics channels with low-energy photons, for instance, a 16% boost in signal significance for $D^{*0}$ from the $B^-\\rightarrow D^{*0}(\\rightarrow D^0 \\gamma)\\pi^-$ decay.",

    "title": "Multi-MeV electron occurrence and lifetimes in the outer radiation belt   and slot region during the maximum of solar cycle 22",
    "abstract": "The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.",

    "title": "A projection method for particle resampling",
    "abstract": "Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as particle noise hamper long time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as particle resampling. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space. This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, 3X in physical space and 3V in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a 1X + 1V Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. Stable long time dynamics are demonstrated up to T = 500 and reproducibility artifacts and data with stable dynamics up to T = 1000 are publicly available.",

    "title": "Wafer-Level Prototyping Tools for CMOS Bioelectronic Sensors",
    "abstract": "Integrating biology with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors can enable highly parallel measurements with minimal parasitic effects, significantly enhancing sensitivity. However, realizing this potential often requires overcoming substantial barriers related to design, fabrication, and heterogeneous integration. In this context, we present a comprehensive suite of tools and methods designed for wafer-scale biosensor prototyping that is sensitive, highly parallelizable, and manufacturable. A central component of our approach is a new initiative that allows for open-source multi-project wafers (MPW), giving all participants access to the designs submitted by others. We demonstrate that this strategy not only promotes design reuse but also facilitates advanced back-end-of-line (BEOL) fabrication techniques, improving the manufacturability and process yield of CMOS biosensors. Developing CMOS-based biosensors also involves the challenge of heterogeneous integration, which includes external electrical, mechanical, and fluid layers. We demonstrate simple modular designs that enable such integration for sample delivery and signal readout. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in measuring the hybridization of DNA molecules by focusing on data acquisition and machine learning (ML) methods that leverage the parallelism of the sensors to enable robust classification of desirable analyte interactions.",

    "abstract": "A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\\mathrm{\\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. The new mechanism is distinct to the known spin-orbit coupling induced intersystem crossing, and it can enhance the overall intersystem crossing rate. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are possible to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.",

    "title": "Calculation and comparison of sensitivities in $0νββ$   experiments based on key parameters",
    "abstract": "Worldwide efforts are underway to detect neutrinoless double beta ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay using experiments based on various technologies and target isotopes. Future experiments in this regard aim to exclude the inverted order (IO) condition or explore the normal order (NO) band. Consequently, comparing the sensitivities of proposed $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay experiments with promising prospects is essential. The current study adopts sensitivity metrics, including exclusion and discovery sensitivities, half-life sensitivities, and $m_{\\beta\\beta}$ sensitivities, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of ten typical promising experiments: LEGEND, CDEX, nEXO, XLZD, PandaX, NEXT, KamLAND-Zen, JUNO, SNO+, and CUPID, and highlight their unique features. Based on reported experimental parameters, the concept of a ``technical line'' is introduced to determine the location that each experiment may realize in the $\\xi$ and $\\lambda_{b}$ space, where $\\xi$ represents the sensitive exposure per year, and $\\lambda_{b}$ denotes the expected annual rate of background events. Half-life sensitivities for the selected experiments are calculated, some of them in multiple phases and others in conservative or aggressive condition. The results indicate that increasing the operation time is more beneficial for zero-background experiments, which also demonstrate greater competitiveness in discovery sensitivity. $m_{\\beta\\beta}$ sensitivities are presented as uncertainty bands arising from the nuclear matrix element uncertainties. Additionally, half-life and $m_{\\beta\\beta}$ sensitivities are estimated under ideal conditions also in the form of uncertainty bands, where only irreducible $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and solar B-8 neutrino induced background remain.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we have carried out a two-dimensional (2D) simulation of thermal instability (TI) in interstellar matter (ISM), considering it to be a weakly ionised inviscid plasma with radiation loss. We carry out the simulation using our multi-fluid flux-corrected transport (mFCT) code, which incorporates a background magnetic field and anisotropic pressure. The anisotropic pressure is modelled with a polybaric pressure model. The findings of our analysis are consistent with the contemporary status of knowledge about the multiphase nature of the ISM, with volume and mass fractions of the various components of the ISM, that is, warm, cold, and unstable neutral matter (UNM) in the ranges reported by various numerical and observational analyses. Though the strength of the background magnetic field only marginally affects the overall evolution, the ratio of the parallel and perpendicular pressures can considerably alter the mass and volume fractions of the three phases, which can affect the overall evolution of the TI in the long run.",

First, the analog performance of the SDR system was evaluated both in loopback and coupled to the cryogenic multiplexing system. Then, the SDR system performance was optimized for {\\mu}MUX readout, focusing on bolometric applications. Finally, the minimum demodulated flux noise was obtained through the optimally conditioned readout of a {\\mu}MUX channel. The results presented are comparable to those obtained with traditional SDR architectures and demonstrate that the Direct-RF SDR prototype is suitable for the readout of {\\mu}MUX devices. We anticipate that Direct-RF SDR technology will play a key role in enabling the next generation of SDR readout systems for frequency-multiplexed low-temperature detector arrays.",

The numerical scheme employs a Jacobian-free Newton--Krylov method with algebraic multigrid preconditioning to overcome the severe time-step limitations imposed by strong mirror forces in fully explicit schemes. Applied to parameters relevant to the WHAM mirror experiment, the IMEX approach enables time steps up to $2.5 \\times 10^4$ times larger than those permitted by explicit methods, resulting in a 2500x speedup in 1D--2V simulations of parallel transport with kinetic ions and Boltzmann electrons. Additionally, a reduced bounce-averaged model for a square mirror is implemented to support the computationally intensive fully kinetic simulations. The bounce-averaged formulation is used to evaluate the numerical convergence of the velocity-space discretization algorithms and to assess the role of the collision model by comparing simulations employing the nonlinear Fokker--Planck and the simplified Lenard--Bernstein--Dougherty collision operators.",
