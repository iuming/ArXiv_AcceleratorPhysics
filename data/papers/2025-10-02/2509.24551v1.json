  "title": "Broadband Magnetless Isolator using Adiabatic Flux Modulation",
  "abstract": "Isolators are commonly found in the amplification chain of microwave setups to shield sensitive devices such as superconducting qubits from noise and back-scattered signals. Conventional ferrite-based isolators are bulky, lossy and rely on strong magnetic fields, which pose challenges for their co-integration in large-scale superconducting devices. Here, we present a magnetless isolator that overcomes these limitations with simulated performances on par with the state-of-the-art. Using a dispersion-engineered transmission line with a propagating adiabatic flux modulation, the simulated device achieves more than 20 dB isolation over a broad frequency band ranging from 4 to 8 GHz, which can be modified based on the device parameters. Moreover, we propose a compact, low-loss, on-chip superconducting device that shows promise against parameter variations and enables a scalable path for co-integration with large-scale superconducting systems of the future.",
