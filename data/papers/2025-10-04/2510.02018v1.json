  "title": "An electro-optical bunch profile monitor for FCC-ee",
  "abstract": "The Future Circular Lepton Collider (FCC-ee) presents challenges for a longitudinal bunch profile monitor due to its wide range of bunch lengths and charge densities across its four distinct operational modes. For commissioning, monitoring the top-up injection, and energy calibration, the FCC-ee requires non-destructive, single-shot measurements of the bunch length and profile. This contribution proposes an in-vacuum electro-optical (EO) longitudinal bunch profile monitor for single-shot measurements at high repetition rates, building on the successful EO monitor at the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A novel single-pass conceptual design for the in-vacuum holder of the electro-optical crystal is presented, utilizing prisms instead of a mirror to guide the laser through the crystal, which additionally allows measurements of the long bunches foreseen for FCC-ee operation mode at the Z-pole energy. A first prototype has been constructed and tested at the in-air test stand of the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR). Results from the prototype tests are presented, demonstrating the proof of principle for the single-pass prism-based EO monitor design for FCC-ee.",
