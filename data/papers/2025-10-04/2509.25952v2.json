  "title": "Gravitational wave experiments: achievements and plans",
  "abstract": "Gravitational wave (GW) experiments have transformed our understanding of the Universe by enabling direct observations of compact object mergers and other astrophysical phenomena. This chapter reviews the concepts of GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and describes their operating principles, data acquisition and analysis techniques, and some of the methods used to extract source properties. The scientific impact of GW observations is discussed as well, including contributions to astrophysics, tests of general relativity, and cosmology. We also examine the role of multimessenger astronomy and the complementarity between different GW detectors and with other astroparticle experiments. Finally, we outline future prospects with next-generation detectors, like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and space-based missions.",
