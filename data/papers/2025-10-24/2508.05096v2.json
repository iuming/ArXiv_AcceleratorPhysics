  "title": "A mobile high spatial-resolution Muography instrument based on   large-area Micromegas detectors",
  "abstract": "Muon radiography is an imaging technique based on muon absorption in matter that allows measurement of internal details in hidden objects or structures. This technique relies on measuring cosmic-ray muons tracks accurately, which reflects the incoming muon flux from both the target object and the open sky. In this paper, we report on the construction of a high spatial resolution muography instrument based on Micromegas detectors. Using four layers of 400 mm ${\\times}$ 400 mm Micromegas detectors, channel multiplexing circuits, and the versatile readout system, a moveable muography instrument named $\\mu$STC-R400 was designed and constructed. Results show that the channel multiplexing circuits can resolve hit positions correctly, and the spatial resolution of the detector is approximately 190 ${\\mu}$m. Experiments were conducted at an under-construction subway tunnel and outdoors near a mountain, demonstrating the ${\\mu}$STC-R400's ability to maintain high spatial resolution outside the laboratory and its robustness in harsh environments.",
