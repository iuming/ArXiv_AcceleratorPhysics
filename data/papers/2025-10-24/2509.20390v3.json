  "title": "Optical characterization of wavelength-shifting and   scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers",
  "abstract": "We report results of optical characterizations of new wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers EJ-182 and EJ-160 from Eljen Technology and compare them to the wavelength-shifting fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain. The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at longer wavelengths. The impact of environmental refractive index was measured by immersing a fiber in water. Immersing the fibers in water reduced the light yield and led to a suppression of the short attenuation length, consistent with the expected decrease in the refractive index contrast.",
