  "title": "Response of wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting   fibers to ionizing radiation",
  "abstract": "We report results of characterizing the response and light transport of wavelength-shifting (WLS) and scintillating-wavelength-shifting (Sci-WLS) fibers under irradiation by radioactive $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ sources. Light yield and light transmission were measured for the WLS fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain and for a new Sci-WLS fiber EJ-160 from Eljen Technology.   The two variants with different fluor mixtures, EJ-160I and EJ-160II, exhibited approximately five and seven times higher light yield than BCF-91A, respectively, while their attenuation lengths were 3.80\\,m for BCF-91A, 4.00\\,m for EJ-160I, and 2.50\\,m for EJ-160II.",
