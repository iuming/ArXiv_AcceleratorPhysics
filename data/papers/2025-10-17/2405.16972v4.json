  "title": "Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing",
  "abstract": "Matter-wave interferometry plays a significant role in scientific research and technological applications. While position-momentum phase-space squeezing has been demonstrated to increase the coherence of atom sources by reducing momentum spread, we theoretically investigate the potential advantages of the opposite squeezing. As a case study, we analytically and numerically examine its effect on point source atom interferometry (PSI) for rotation sensing. Our analysis reveals that this squeezed PSI (SPSI) approach can significantly improve sensitivity and dynamic range while enabling shorter cycle times and higher repetition rates. Through simulations, we identify parameter spaces where sensitivity and dynamic range are enhanced by orders of magnitude. Under a specific definition of compactness, our calculations show that SPSI outperforms standard PSI by over four orders of magnitude. These theoretical findings suggest that SPSI could either enhance performance in standard-sized devices or maintain performance in miniaturized chip-scale devices, potentially paving the way for new practical applications.",
