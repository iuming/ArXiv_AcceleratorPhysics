  "title": "Intense and Tunable Multi-color Terahertz Radiation from Laser-Shaped   Electron Beams",
  "abstract": "High-power multi-color terahertz (THz) radiation exhibits extraordinary scientific application prospects at various scientific frontiers, for its capacity to deliver THz excitation at multiple frequencies simultaneously. However, the generation of high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequencies remains a challenge for existing techniques. Here, a technique by combining the multi-laser pulses frequency beating and coherent undulator amplification is proposed for generating high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequency. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed technique can produce multi-color THz radiation with three to six distinguished colors and a peak power up to hundreds of MW, and the temporally separated two-color pulses can also be produced by employing undulators with different resonance. Due to the intrinsic properties of the proposed technique, the THz frequencies, the color number and the frequency interval can be effectively controlled by simply adjusting the beating laser. This method paves the way for advanced application of THz pump-THz probe experiments for selective excitation of atomic multi-level systems and molecular fingerprint recognition.",
