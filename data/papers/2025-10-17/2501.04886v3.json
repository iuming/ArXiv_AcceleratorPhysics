  "title": "Distributed network of smartphone sensors: a new tool for scientific   field measurements",
  "abstract": "Smartphones sensors are now commonly used by a worldwide audience thanks to their availability, high connectivity, and versatility. Here, we present a methodology to use a collection of smartphones, namely a fleet, as a distributed network of time-synchronized mechanical sensors. We first present the mechanical tests we develop to evaluate the smartphone sensor accuracy. We then describe how to use efficiently a distributed network of smartphones as autonomous sensors. We use a combination of an Android application hosted on each phone (Gobannos), and a server application (Phonefleet) on a controlling host to perform the tasks in parallel remotely. We detail the time synchronisation protocol we implemented, based on UDP communication. We achieved an accuracy of the time synchronisation of 60 microseconds, more than enough for all mechanical applications. Eventually, we present two test cases in which we use a smartphone fleet for mechanical wave measurements in field conditions.",
