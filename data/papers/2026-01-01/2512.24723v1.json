  "title": "Cataloging the nonlinear waves excited by moving a charged body in the dusty plasma medium",
  "abstract": "The nonlinear waves excited by the movement of a charged body in the dusty plasma medium are studied. A charged body moving through a dusty plasma medium can generate diverse nonlinear waves, such as precursors and pinned solitons. These wave excitations under weakly nonlinear and dispersive limits are described theoretically by the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) type equation. We have examined the role of the driver in shaping and evolving these wave excitations. In particular we studied the effect of primarily three source parameters, namely, amplitude, width, and flow speed, on the evolution of nonlinear structures. The driver generates a perturbation in the stable system configuration, which couples with medium characteristics and eventually evolves into propagating excitations. Our finding shows that the excitation of nonlinear structure by a moving body in a plasma medium is not just dictated by the mach number but also the features of the source such as amplitude and width. As a novel finding apart from pinned and precursor solitons, we observe another nonlinear structure that lags behind the source term, maintaining its shape and speed as it propagates. These features are the first ever theoretical depiction of such lagging structures.",
