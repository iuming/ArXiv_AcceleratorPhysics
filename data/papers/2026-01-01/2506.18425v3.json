  "title": "Spatial, Spectral and Temporal Response of High Intensity Laser Plasma Mirrors- Direct Observation of the Ponderomotive Push",
  "abstract": "Plasma-based optics have emerged as a powerful platform for manipulating and amplifying ultra-intense laser pulses. However, the inherently nonlinear and dynamic nature of plasma leads to significant spatial, spectral, and temporal modulations when driven at relativistic intensities. These modifications can dramatically alter the structure of the reflected laser pulses, posing challenges for their use in applications such as vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and X-ray generation, as well as relativistic particle acceleration. Comprehensive, multidimensional diagnostics are essential to accurately characterize these so-called `plasma mirrors' (PMs). We present a direct, \\textit{in situ} measurement of the three-dimensional plasma surface evolution during femtosecond laser irradiation, achieved through simultaneous analysis of the wavefront, spectrum, and temporal profile of the reflected light. Our measurements reveal surface deformations on the order of a few hundred nanometers at relativistic intensities, in agreement with three-dimensional particle-in-cell (3D-PIC) simulations. Additionally, the PM induces substantial modifications to the pulse spectrum and temporal profile, introducing spatio-temporal couplings.",
