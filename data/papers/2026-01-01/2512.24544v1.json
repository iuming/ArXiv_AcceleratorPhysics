  "title": "Computing Flux-Surface Shapes in Tokamaks and Stellarators",
  "abstract": "There is currently no agreed-upon methodology for characterizing a stellarator magnetic field geometry, and yet modern stellarator designs routinely attain high levels of magnetic-field quasi-symmetry through careful flux-surface shaping. Here, we introduce a general method for computing the shape of an ideal-MHD equilibrium that can be used in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric configurations. This framework uses a Fourier mode analysis to define the shaping modes (e.g. elongation, triangularity, squareness, etc.) of cross-sections that can be non-planar. Relative to an axisymmetric equilibrium, the additional degree of freedom in a non-axisymmetric equilibrium manifests as a rotation of each shaping mode about the magnetic axis. Using this method, a shaping analysis is performed on non-axisymmetric configurations with precise quasi-symmetry and select cases from the QUASR database spanning a range of quasi-symmetry quality. Empirically, we find that quasi-symmetry results from a spatial resonance between shape complexity and shape rotation about the magnetic axis. The quantitative features of this resonance correlate closely with a configuration's rotational transform and number of field periods. Based on these observations, it is conjectured that this shaping paradigm can facilitate systematic investigations into the relationship between general flux-surface geometries and other figures of merit.",
