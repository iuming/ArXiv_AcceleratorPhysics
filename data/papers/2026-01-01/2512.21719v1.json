  "title": "SiPM-based photodetectors for spectroscopic measurements in wide dynamic range",
  "abstract": "The results of measurements of the characteristics of photodetectors based on large-area SiPM matrices with a wide dynamic range are presented. The potential application of SiPM-based photodetectors for electromagnetic calorimetry in the energy range from hundreds of keV to tens of GeV is explored. The potential application of SiPM in gamma-spectroscopy is also discussed.",
