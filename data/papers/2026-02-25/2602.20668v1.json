  "title": "Development of a cost-effective X-ray imaging device based on Raspberry Pi Camera",
  "abstract": "This study reports the development and characterization of a cost-effective X-ray imaging device built from Raspberry Pi components, including a high-quality 12.3-megapixel camera configured for indirect detection with a Gd2O2S: Tb scintillation screen. The device was evaluated under both ambient light and X-ray exposure conditions. Initial characterization under ambient light ensured proper optical focusing; subsequently, camera settings (ISO and exposure time) were evaluated and optimized for X-ray imaging performance. Spatial resolution of the developed device was quantified using the Slanted-Edge method to derive the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The device achieves MTF20 values of 68 lp/mm under ambient light and 25 lp/mm under X-ray irradiation (50 and 70 kV) with Gd2O2S:Tb screen. Besides, the modularity of the developed device was confirmed by conducting the tests with LYSO:Ce and GAGG:Ce screens. Results demonstrate that this compact, cost-effective platform delivers spatial resolution comparable to clinical radiography systems, with potential applications in scientific, educational, and medical contexts where cost and portability are critical factors.",
