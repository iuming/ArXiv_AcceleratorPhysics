  "title": "Driver-delay chicanes for a multistage plasma-based accelerator facility",
  "abstract": "The SPARTA project aims to design a medium-sized accelerator facility that facilitates new experiments in strong-field quantum electrodynamics using plasma-based accelerators. For this, we need several plasma stages and, therefore, several drivers. Drivers can be either an ultra-relativistic charged particle beam or a high-intensity laser beam. In case we use particle beams, we need a method of distributing these beams from a radio-frequency accelerator to the different plasma stages. A central part of this is a delay scheme that ensures temporal synchronization of the drivers. In this paper, we demonstrate how to achieve a 2 ns delay in $\\sim$12 m, while keeping the first-order beam parameters periodic.",
