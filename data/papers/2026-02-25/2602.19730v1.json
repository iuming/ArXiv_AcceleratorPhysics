  "title": "Designing electrostatic MEMS-based electron optics: the case of the spiral phase plate",
  "abstract": "A new generation of microfabricated MEMS for electron optics is changing electron microscopy for the better. These devices allow operations on the electron beam that are impossible with conventional electron optics. Unprecedented phase landscapes like tunable spiral phase plates and localized strong phase gradients are just some examples of what can be achieved. This work establishes the methodological foundation to design and control MEMS based phase plates. The design strategy is rooted on a novel analytical and numerical modeling of thin electrodes with accurate account of the fringing fields having a major role in the thin-MEMS geometry. We designed, fabricated and characterized experimentally a spiral phase plate, and assessed the quality of the generated vortex beam while discussing the most relevant control parameters and design approaches.",
