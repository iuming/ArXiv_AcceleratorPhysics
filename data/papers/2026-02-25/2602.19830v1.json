  "title": "Superconducting Accelerator Magnets",
  "abstract": "This course introduces key aspects of superconducting magnet technology in accelerators: basic principles, superconducting materials (NbTi, Nb$_3$Sn, ReBCO), wire and cable architectures, and fabrication methods. Compared to copper or permanent magnets, superconducting systems require cryogenics and complex protection schemes but enable superior performance. Core challenges - like flux pinning, magnetization effects, quench behavior, mechanical forces interception, power tests and magnetic measurements - are addressed through examples of magnets from PSI and CERN.",
