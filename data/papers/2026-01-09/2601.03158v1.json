  "title": "Optimization of Cryogenic Detector Test Station by Rejecting Electromagnetic Interference",
  "abstract": "We report on the solution optimized for characterizing SNSPDs by rejecting electromagnetic interference from various sources. The proposed readout method enhances measurement stability and enables reliable device characterization at low bias currents, where the signal-to-noise ratio is typically limited. By effectively suppressing EMI-induced noise, the method improves the ability to distinguish genuine detection events from spurious signals and reduces the effort required for data analysis. The approach has been applied to preliminary measurements of SNSPDs exposed to $α$ particles emitted from a $^{241}$Am source, demonstrating stable operation and clean signal acquisition. While a detailed study of $α$ detection is underway, the method establishes a foundation for further characterization of SNSPDs with various incident particles. The demonstrated EMI rejection technique is expected to facilitate future research in particle detection and support ongoing SNSPD development for applications in nuclear and accelerator-based experiments.",
