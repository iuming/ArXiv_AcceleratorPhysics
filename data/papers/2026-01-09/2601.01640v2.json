  "title": "Simourg2.0 -- Geant4 application for simulation of nuclear detectors with simple geometries",
  "abstract": "Simourg is a software based on the Geant4 toolkit and provides the Monte Carlo simulation of nuclear spectrometric setups with simple geometries for such applications as nuclear decay research, radiation safety, and nuclear medicine. With just a few command lines, users can define simple geometries, materials, and radiation sources to obtain reliable approximations for typical experimental setups. Simourg version 2.0, currently in its prerelease stage, introduces extended functionality for data extraction, geometry configuration, debugging, and visualization.",
