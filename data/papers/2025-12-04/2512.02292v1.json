  "title": "Solitary Alfvén Waves",
  "abstract": "We present a three-dimensional numerical model of a solitary spherically polarized Alfvén wave packet -- an Alfvénon, characterized by open field-line topology and magnetic field reversals, resembling the switchbacks observed by Parker Solar Probe to be a nearly ubiquitous feature of turbulence in the inner heliosphere. Direct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the constructed Alfvénon demonstrates remarkable stability, confirming its nature as an exact, nonlinear solution of the ideal MHD equations.",
