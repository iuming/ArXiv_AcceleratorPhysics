  "title": "Progress in relativistic laser-plasma interaction with kilotesla-level applied magnetic fields",
  "abstract": "We report on progress in the understanding of the effects of kilotesla-level applied magnetic fields on relativistic laser-plasma interactions. Ongoing advances in magnetic-field-generation techniques enable new and highly desirable phenomena, including magnetic-field-amplification platforms with reversible sign, focusing ion acceleration, and bulk-relativistic plasma heating. Building on recent advancements in laser-plasma interactions with applied magnetic fields, we introduce simple models for evaluating the effects of applied magnetic fields in magnetic-field amplification, sheath-based ion acceleration, and direct laser acceleration. These models indicate the feasibility of observing beneficial magnetic-field effects under experimentally relevant conditions and offer a starting point for future experimental design.",
