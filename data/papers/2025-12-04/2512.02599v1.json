  "title": "CZT Detectors for kaonic atoms spectroscopy",
  "abstract": "Cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors offer excellent room-temperature energy resolution, making them well suited for X- and $γ$-ray spectroscopy in challenging environments. Within the SIDDHARTA-2 program at the DA$Φ$NE collider, a new CZT-based detection system has been developed to enable precision measurements of kaonic atom transitions in the intermediate mass range. In this work, we report the results of a calibration campaign performed with the collider operating, aimed at assessing the detector performance. A dedicated setup, including an array of quasi-hemispherical CZT sensors and a $^{152}$Eu source, was used to characterize the spectral response. The reconstructed emission lines were fitted with a model accounting for Gaussian response and incomplete charge recollection tails, and the detector linearity was evaluated by comparing the measured peak positions with their nominal energies. The results demonstrate that the CZT detector exhibits excellent linearity and stable operation with the collider on, confirming its suitability for future kaonic-atom spectroscopy at DA$Φ$NE.",
