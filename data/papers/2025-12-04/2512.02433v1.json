  "title": "Study of fully coupled 3D envelope instability using automatic differentiation",
  "abstract": "Auto-differentiation is a powerful tool for computing derivatives of simulation results with respect to given parameters. In this letter, we have applied this tool to investigate the instability of a dynamics system that is governed by 21 ordinary differential equations. This second-order instability (named envelope instability) is driven by space-charge effects and has significant impact on the operational regimes of particle accelerators. Our study delves into the three-dimensional envelope instability, incorporating both transverse and longitudinal coupling. Conventionally, analyzing this complex system would necessitate solving 441 ordinary differential equations, which is computationally intractable. However, by employing auto-differentiation, we were able to track only 21 equations. This approach allowed us to uncover an additional instability stopband, which arises from space-charge-induced coupling and has not been reported in previous studies. This research highlights the significant advantages of auto-differentiation in analyzing complicated dynamical systems involving a large number of ordinary differential equations.",
