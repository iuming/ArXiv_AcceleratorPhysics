  "title": "A novel method for thermal noise reduction, enabling measurements of broadband, low-amplitude electron temperature fluctuations using individual radiometer channels",
  "abstract": "A new analysis method has been developed for measurements of broadband, low-amplitude turbulent electron temperature fluctuations in fusion plasmas using individual radiometer channels of a Correlation Electron Cyclotron Emission (CECE) diagnostic. This method takes advantage of differences in the correlation time of thermal noise compared to the correlation time of plasma fluctuations in fusion reactors. The validation of this single-channel method is demonstrated using comparisons with the standard dual-channel radiometer spectral decorrelation method for measurements of turbulent electron temperature fluctuations in the core and edge of low confinement (L), improved confinement (I), and high confinement (H)-mode plasmas at the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak.",
