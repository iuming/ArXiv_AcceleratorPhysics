  "title": "High-beta equilibrium in mirror machine with population of fast sloshing ions",
  "abstract": "A method of constructing the high-beta (diamagnetic-bubble-like) equilibrium with a population of fast sloshing ions is discussed. Fast ions move along betatron orbits; such ions can arise because of off-axis neutral beam injection. Conservation of the adiabatic invariant of these ions is proposed; a simplified expression for the invariant is presented. Numerical examples of equilibrium with sloshing ions are shown and conservation of the invariant is justified by a direct numerical simulation of motion of fast ions even in the case with beta equal to 1.",
