  "title": "Classical and Quantum Beam Dynamics Simulation of the RF Photoinjector Test Bench at JINR",
  "abstract": "We present beam-dynamics simulations for an S-band RF photoinjector test bench under development at JINR, aimed at producing high-quality electron beams and enabling future generation of relativistic vortex electrons. Simulations of the 1.5-cell photogun under the presently available RF gradient of ~45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge forces are weak, and the transverse emittance is dominated by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and cathode-region solenoid yields a robust emittance-stabilization regime with a final normalized emittance of ~3.2 pi mm mrad. To assess prospects for accelerating structured electron beams, we additionally model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The results show that multi-MeV acceleration suppresses free-space spreading and preserves the wave-packet's initial OAM structure, indicating that the test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.",
