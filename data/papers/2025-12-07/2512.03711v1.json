  "title": "Compton suppressed scintillation spectrometer based on a cluster of 9$\\times$CeBr$_{3}$-NaI(Tl) phoswich detectors",
  "abstract": "Measurements of the characteristics of an Compton suppressed spectrometer consisting of 9$\\times$CeBr$_{3}$-NaI(Tl) phoswich detectors surrounded by four CsI(Tl) scintillation detectors intended for suppressing the Compton component of the spectrum have been carried out. Measurements were performed using gamma and neutron radiation sources. Key parameters of the spectrometer have been determined: the suppression factor of the Compton part of the $γ$-spectrum, as well as the dependencies of the neutron detection efficiency on their energy at various detection threshold values.",
