  "title": "Synchronized Catastrophic Collapse and Extreme Intensity Amplification   of Ultra-Intense Pulses in Near-Resonance Magnetized Plasma",
  "abstract": "Achieving ultra-high field intensities is paramount for advancing compact plasma accelerators and high-energy-density physics, yet it is fundamentally limited by the constraints of focusing distance and nonlinear efficiency. We report a theoretical model demonstrating a highly efficient, magnetically-assisted pathway for extreme laser energy concentration in under-dense plasma. By tuning an external magnetic field near the cyclotron resonance (Ce=0.7), we show a fundamental, nonlinear enhancement of the relativistic self-focusing (RSF) mechanism. This magnetic enhancement drives the pulse into a catastrophic, coupled collapse over an exceptionally short distance of 1.25 Rayleigh lengths. The dynamics result in simultaneous spatial confinement (fr=0.05) and significant temporal self-compression (ft=0.60 ). Crucially, this combined confinement yields a localized peak intensity amplification factor exceeding 103 compared to the initial state. This work confirms a robust and compact method for generating petawatt-scale power densities and provides a direct, actionable blueprint for next-generation laser-plasma experiments.",
