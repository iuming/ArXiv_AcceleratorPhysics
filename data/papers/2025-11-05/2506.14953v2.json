  "title": "Fourier Transform Method Of A Detailed Configuration Accounting In Hot   Plasma Bound-Bound Opacity Calculations",
  "abstract": "G.~Hazak and J.~Kurzweil discovered a method of configurational resolution of transition arrays for the Super Transition Arrays approach to the bound-bound opacity calculation. Their method is based on the representation of the photoabsorption coefficient as the Fourier transform, the linearity of the transition energy between configurations with respect to shell occupation numbers, and factorization of the probabilities of configurations on shell occupation numbers. We extend the Hazak -- Kurzweil method for the calculations with Detailed Configuration Accounting. The resulting expressions for the bound-bound opacity represent an alternative to the widely used ones and are quite convenient for numerical implementation.",
