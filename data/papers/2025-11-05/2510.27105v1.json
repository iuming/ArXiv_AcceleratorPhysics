  "title": "Plasma fibre using bright-core helicon plasma",
  "abstract": "This paper reports an innovative concept of ``plasma fibre\" using bright-core helicon plasma, inspired by its spatial and spectral similarities to the well-known optical fibre. Theoretical analyses are presented for both ideal case of step-like density profile and the realistic case of Gaussian density profile in radius. The total reflection of electromagnetic waves near the sharp plasma density gradient and consequently the wave-guide feature could indeed happen if the incident angle is larger than a threshold value. Numerical computations using electromagnetic solver that based on Maxwell's equations and cold-plasma dielectric tensor yield consistent results. The experimental verification and prospective applications are also suggested. The ``plasma fibre\" could be functional component that embedded into existing communication systems for special purpose based on its capability of dynamic reconfiguration.",
