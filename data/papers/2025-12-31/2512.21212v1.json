  "title": "Study of laser-beam arrival time synchronization towards sub-picosecond stability level",
  "abstract": "A precise synchronization between laser pulse and electron beam arrival time is essential for achieving sub-picosecond stability in modern accelerator facilities. In this work, a Low-Level RF system architecture combined with White Rabbit based timing system has been tested through a collaboration between KEK (Japan) and CNRS/IN2P3, IJClab (France). The setup combines a frequency standard generator, an IDROGEN carrier board with an embedded White Rabbit node, and SkyWorks synthesizers of different form factors to distribute phase-locked clock signals over telecommunication fiber. Phase noise power spectral density measurements were performed at several RF sub-harmonics to confirm synchronization performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the White Rabbit-IDROGEN synchronization scheme for large-scale accelerators, including applications to laser-based diagnostics.",
