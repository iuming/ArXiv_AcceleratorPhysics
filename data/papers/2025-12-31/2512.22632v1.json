  "title": "Stringent constraints on non-standard neutrino interactions using high-purity $ν_μ$ CC events in IceCube DeepCore",
  "abstract": "The neutral-current (NC) non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with fermions can modify the flavor oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos as they propagate through the Earth. We present constraints on the NC-NSI parameters $\\varepsilon_{μτ}$ and $\\varepsilon_{ττ}-\\varepsilon_{μμ}$ (one at a time) using a high-purity sample of $ν_μ$ charged-current (CC) atmospheric neutrino events collected by IceCube DeepCore over 7.5 years of livetime. These two parameters significantly affect the $ν_μ$ disappearance channel for which this golden event sample is optimized by the IceCube Collaboration. The best fit to this dataset is consistent with no NSI hypothesis, and we place the most stringent constraints to date: $-\\,0.0094 < \\varepsilon_{μτ} < 0.0079$ and $-\\,0.030 < \\varepsilon_{ττ}-\\varepsilon_{μμ} < 0.029$ at 90% confidence level.",
