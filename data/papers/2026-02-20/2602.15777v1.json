  "title": "New Challenges in Plasma Accelerators: Final Focusing for Wakefield Colliders",
  "abstract": "The focusing of particle beams for collider experiments is crucial for maximizing the luminosity and thus the discovery potential of these machines. In recent years, plasma wakefield acceleration has emerged as a leading candidate for achieving higher energy collisions with smaller facility footprints due to the large accelerating gradients in the plasma. This higher beam energy poses significant challenges for the final focusing system of the collider. Here, we discuss the various challenges of final focusing for TeV-scale plasma accelerators and propose possible solutions. Finally, we present the first design of a final focusing system for a 10 TeV linear wakefield collider, evaluate its performance, and discuss its shortcomings as well as improvements for future designs.",
