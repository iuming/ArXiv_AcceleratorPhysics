  "title": "Magnetic Field Amplification and Particle Acceleration in Weakly Magnetized Trans-relativistic Electron-ion Shocks",
  "abstract": "We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel trans-relativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(σ\\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(σ\\lesssim10^{-4})$. Bell-dominated shocks efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}\\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\\max}\\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{e}}\\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell-dominated regime. On the other hand, Weibel-dominated shocks efficiently generate both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}\\sim\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{e}}\\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\\mathrm{max}}\\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.",
