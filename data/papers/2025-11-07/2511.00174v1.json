  "title": "Observation of Ion-wave Satellites to Laser Harmonics in Intense   Picosecond Laser-Solid Interaction",
  "abstract": "Detailed spectra of harmonics produced from ultra-intense, sub-picosecond, high-contrast laser pulses incident on solid targets have shown the first observation of regular red- and blue-shifted satellites. Their frequency shift is slightly less than the frequency of a nominal, pure ion-plasma wave associated with electron critical density, where an ion-acoustic wave would be expected. We explain this as the result of a substantial reduction of Debye shielding as the intense optical fields compete to drive electrons in large-amplitude oscillations. This general effect leads to a larger, dynamical and anisotropic Debye length, which should have a broad impact on plasma physics in this regime.",
