  "title": "Radiation damage study of a p-type silicon sensor under extreme particle   fluence",
  "abstract": "We investigate the radiation tolerance of p-type silicon pad sensors, indigenously developed for use in high-fluence environments relevant to heavy-ion collider experiments, cosmic-ray observatories, and deep-space missions. Single-pad test structures were irradiated with neutrons over a range of fluence, and post-irradiation performance was characterized. The evolution of leakage current and the calorimetric response of the devices were systematically analyzed as functions of accumulated neutron fluence. In addition, we introduce a simple exponential-annealing model that predicts the time dependence of leakage current after irradiation. The measurements and model together quantify performance degradation and recovery trends, providing guidance for the design and operation of silicon-based calorimetry in harsh radiation environments.",
