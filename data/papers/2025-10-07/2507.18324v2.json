  "title": "Plasma Position Constrained Free-Boundary MHD Equilibrium in Tokamaks   using pyIPREQ",
  "abstract": "A free-boundary, axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium code, pyIPREQ, has been developed for Tokamak plasmas using finite difference and Green's function approach. The code builds upon the foundational frameworks of the PEST and IPREQ codes, introducing several enhancements and new capabilities. Notably, pyIPREQ supports the specification of limiter boundaries and enables the computation of key physical quantities. The code has also been extended to compute equilibria constrained by a prescribed magnetic axis position, which is particularly useful when such information can be inferred from the diagnostics data. In addition, pyIPREQ includes functionality to address vertical instabilities, a requirement for accurately modeling elongated plasma configurations. Benchmarking has been carried out against published results and the original IPREQ code. Applications are demonstrated for ADITYA-U Tokamak experiments, where magnetic axis measurements are available, and predictions are also made for SST-1 and ADITYA-U Tokamaks under various operational scenarios.",
