  "title": "Is Turbulence able to Generate Magnetic Islands in Tokamaks? Gyrokinetic   Simulations of Turbulence-Driven Magnetic Islands in Toroidal Geometry",
  "abstract": "We report a universal mechanism for turbulence-driven magnetic islands in fusion plasmas. Using gyrokinetic simulations of a linearly stable tearing mode in a large-aspect-ratio toroidal geometry under collisionless conditions, we demonstrate that micro-instabilities generate an $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ flow that drives magnetic field line reconnection. This process forms multiple small-scale islands along the resonant surface, which interact nonlinearly and eventually coalesce into large-scale magnetic islands. These islands are capable of significantly flattening the equilibrium profile across the island O-points and thus acting as a seed for their further neoclassical growth. Notably, the mechanism operates independently of the parity of the destabilizing micro-instability.",
