  "title": "From the Virgo interferometer calibration to the bias and uncertainty of the h(t) detector strain during the O4 run",
  "abstract": "Since the first gravitational wave detection in 2015, ground-based interferometer sensitivities have significantly improved, requiring highly precise calibration to ensure accurate reconstruction of the h(t) strain signal. In this talk we will outline the Virgo interferometer calibration steps performed in preparation of the O4b run started in April 2024. We will first describe the Photon Calibrator power devices intercalibration allowing for a 0.48% precision on mirror displacement. Before explaining how the Photon Calibrator is used to calibrate every Virgo mirror actuators. We will also discuss the monitoring of the h(t) strain reconstruction during the run showing that, on the 10 Hz to 2 kHz band, the reconstructed strain achieves a precision of 2% in modulus and 30 mrad in phase. Special emphasis will be given on the newly developed frequency-dependent bias and uncertainty computation method and the resulting online unbiasing of the h(t) strain.",
