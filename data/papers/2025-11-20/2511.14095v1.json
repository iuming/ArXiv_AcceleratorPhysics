  "title": "Studying AC-LGAD strip sensors from laser and testbeam measurements",
  "abstract": "This paper presents the setup assembled to characterize and measure the spatial and timing resolutions of AC-coupled Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (AC-LGADs), using a 1060 nm laser source to deposit initial charges with a defined calibration methodology. The results were compared to those obtained with a 120 GeV proton beam. Despite the differences in the charge deposition mechanism between the laser and proton beam, the spatial and temporal resolutions were found to be compatible between the two sources after calibration. With 4D tracking detectors expected to play a vital role in upcoming collider experiments, we foresee this work as a way to evaluate the performance of semiconductor sensors that can augment testbeam measurements and accelerate R$\\&$D efforts. Additionally, simulation studies using Silvaco TCAD and Weightfield2 were carried out to understand the various contributing factors to the total time resolution in AC-LGAD sensors, measured using the laser source.",
