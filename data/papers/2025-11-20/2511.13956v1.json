  "title": "Calorimeter Pileup Deconvolution for Online Trigger Primitives",
  "abstract": "In high energy physics experiment, as the luminosity increases, pile-up issues on detectors such as calorimeters become non-negligible. Deconvolution approaches with mathematic pre-assumptions such as Sparse Representation are developed for data analysis stage. For online computation tasks such as for trigger primitive creation, signal availability is significantly different as in offline data analysis stage, and therefore, different (yet simpler) algorithms should be explored. In this document, several approaches of deconvolution suitable for FPGA implementation are discussed.",
