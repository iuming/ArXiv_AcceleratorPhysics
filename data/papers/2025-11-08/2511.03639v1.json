  "title": "High-Q Superconducting Lumped-Element Resonators for Low-Mass Axion   Searches",
  "abstract": "Low-frequency superconducting lumped-element resonators have recently attracted significant attention in the context of axion dark matter searches. Here we present the design and implementation of a fixed-frequency superconducting resonator operating near $250~\\mathrm{kHz}$, possessing an inductor volume of $\\sim 1$ liter and achieving an unloaded quality factor $Q \\approx 2.1\\times10^{6}$. This resonator represents a significant improvement over the state of the art and informs the design of searches for low-mass axions.",
