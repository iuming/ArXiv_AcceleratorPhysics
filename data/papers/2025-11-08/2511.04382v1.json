  "title": "Lattice design of a storage-ring-based light source for generating   high-power fully coherent EUV radiation",
  "abstract": "We present the physical design and systematic optimization of a high-performance storage ring tailored for the generation of high-power coherent radiation, with particular emphasis on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime. The proposed ring adopts a Double Bend Achromat (DBA) lattice configuration and integrates 12 superconducting wigglers to significantly enhance radiation damping and minimize the natural emittance. And a bypass line is adopted to generate high power coherent radiation. Comprehensive linear and nonlinear beam dynamics analyses have been conducted to ensure beam stability and robustness across the operational parameter space. The optimized design achieves a natural emittance of approximately 0.8 nm and a longitudinal damping time of around 1.4 ms, enabling the efficient buildup of coherent radiation. Three-dimensional numerical simulations, incorporating the previously proposed angular dispersion-induced microbunching (ADM) mechanism, further confirm the system's capability to generate high-power EUV coherent radiation, with output powers reaching the order of several hundred watts. These results underscore the strong potential of the proposed design for applications in coherent photon science and EUV lithography.",
