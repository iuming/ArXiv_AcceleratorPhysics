    "title": "Machine Learning for Electron-Scale Turbulence Modeling in W7-X",
    "abstract": "Constructing reduced models for turbulent transport is essential for accelerating profile predictions and enabling many-query tasks such as uncertainty quantification, parameter scans, and design optimization. This paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\\eta_e$), and the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\\tau$). We first construct models across seven radial locations using regression and an active machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\\%$ prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.",

Differently to the usual plane wave solution, which is written in terms of separation of variables, all our solutions are along the light-cone coordinates. This allow us to find several new wavepacket solutions whose functionality properties rely on the conditions imposed on the choice for their light-cone coordinates dependence. The presented wavepacket solutions are constructed in terms of multiplications of Airy functions, Parabolic cylinder functions, Mathieu functions, or Bessel functions. We thoroughly analyze the case of a double Airy solution, which have new electromagnetic properties, as a defined wavefront, and velocity faster than the electromagnetic plane wave counterpart solution. It is also mentioned how more general structured wavepackets can be constructed from these new solutions.",

    "abstract": "This review consolidates experimental, theoretical, and simulation work examining the behavior of high-field devices and the fundamental process of vacuum arc initiation, commonly referred to as breakdown. Detailed experimental observations and results relating to a wide range of aspects of high-field devices, including conditioning, field and temperature dependence of breakdown rate, and the ability to sustain high electric fields as a function of device geometry and materials, are presented. The different observations are then addressed theoretically, and with simulation, capturing the sequence of processes that lead to vacuum breakdown and explaining the major observed experimental dependencies. The core of the work described in this review was carried out by a broad multi-disciplinary collaboration in an over a decade-long program to develop high-gradient, 100 MV/m-range, accelerating structures for the CLIC project, a possible future linear-collider high-energy physics facility. Connections are made to the broader linear collider, high-field, and breakdown communities.",

    "title": "Approaching the thermodynamic limit of a bounded one-component plasma",
    "abstract": "The classical one-component plasma (OCP) bounded by a spherical surface reflecting ions (BOCP) is studied using molecular dynamics (MD). Simulations performed for a series of sufficiently large BOCP's make it possible to establish the size dependencies for the investigated quantities and extrapolate them to the thermodynamic limit. In particular, the total electrostatic energy per ion is estimated in the limit of infinite BOCP in a wide range of the Coulomb coupling parameter $\\Gamma$ from 0.03 to 1000 with the relative error of the order 0.1%. Calculated energies are by about 0.5% lower as compared to the modern Monte Carlo (MC) simulation data obtained by different authors at $\\Gamma<30$ and almost coincide with the MC results at $\\Gamma>175$. We introduce two more converging characteristic energies, the excess interatomic electrostatic energy and the excess ion-background electrostatic energy, which enable us to calculate the ionic compressibility factor inaccessible in conventional MC and MD simulation of the OCP with periodic boundary conditions. The derived wide-range ionic equation of state can be recommended for testing OCP simulations with various effective interaction potentials. Based on this equation, we propose an improved cutoff radius for the interionic forces implemented in LAMMPS and perform MD simulation of the OCP to demonstrate that location of the metastable region of the fluid-solid phase transition depends sensitively on this radius.",

    "title": "The Moving Beam Diffraction Geometry: the DIAD Application of a   Diffraction Scanning-Probe",
    "abstract": "Understanding the interactions between microstructure, strain, phase, and material behavior is crucial in many scientific fields. However, quantifying these correlations is challenging, as it requires the use of multiple instruments and techniques, often separated by space and time. The Dual Imaging And Diffraction (DIAD) beamline at Diamond is designed to address this challenge. DIAD allows its users to visualize internal structures, identify compositional/phase changes, and measure strain. DIAD provides two independent beams combined at one sample position, allowing quasi-simultaneous X-ray Computed Tomography and X-ray Powder Diffraction. A unique functionality of the DIAD configuration is the ability to perform image-guided diffraction, where the micron-sized diffraction beam is scanned over the complete area of the imaging field of view without moving the specimen. This moving beam diffraction geometry enables the study of fast-evolving and motion-susceptible processes and samples. Here, we discuss the novel moving beam diffraction geometry presenting the latest findings on the reliability of both geometry calibration and data reduction routines used. Our measures confirm diffraction is most sensitive to the moving geometry for the detector position downstream normal to the incident beam. The observed data confirm that the motion of the KB mirror coupled with a fixed aperture slit results in a rigid translation of the beam probe, without affecting the angle of the incident beam path to the sample. Our measures demonstrate a nearest-neighbour calibration can achieve the same accuracy as a self-calibrated geometry when the distance between calibrated and probed sample region is smaller or equal to the beam spot size. We show the absolute error of the moving beam diffraction geometry remains below 0.0001, which is the accuracy we observe for the beamline with stable beam operation.",

    "abstract": "This paper briefly presents an order statistic approach to the time distribution of the first detected event after a primary avalanche breakdown from a mixture of correlated and dark counting processes. The well-known order statistic method, commonly used to describe the time resolution of scintillation detectors, is applied to the arrival times of correlated events. The established model of crosstalk as a branching Poisson process is extended to afterpulsing, and correlated events are considered starting from their seeds -- free (de-trapped or diffused) charge carriers capable of triggering secondary avalanche breakdowns. The proposed approach enables the extraction of timing information for delayed crosstalk and afterpulsing events mixed with dark counts and predicts that the distribution of the first arrival time narrows as the number of seeds increases, corresponding to a higher probability of correlated events.",

    "abstract": "As a critical component of power supply systems, low-voltage distribution net-works directly affect grid stability and user power supply reliability, yet they face significant threats from lightning-induced faults. Transient simulations are more economical and adaptable for investigating lightning-induced faults in low-voltage distribution networks than experiments. A hybrid Variable Time Step (VTS)-Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method, has been validat-ed in previous study, is used for Lightning-induced Electromagnetic Pulse (LEMP) simulation and fault analysis. The lightning-induced faults in ex-tended unequal-length double-circuit low-voltage distribution networks are ana-lyzed in this paper. The impact of lightning stroke location on overvoltage and fault risk is the primary focus of this study. Key findings indicate that, for ground strokes in front of the center of one double circuit, similar three-phase negative and bipolar oscillatory waveforms that are linked to fault initiation emerge. Closer strokes promote bipolar waveforms with the main peak negative as well as higher overvoltages and fault risk. These results provide essential insights for under-standing lightning-induced fault mechanisms, thereby laying a foundation for formulating more targeted and effective lightning protection measures.",

    "title": "Mitigating effects of nonlinearities in homodyne quadrature   interferometers",
    "abstract": "Homodyne Quadrature interferometers (HoQI) are an interferometric displacement sensing scheme proven to have excellent noise performance, making them a strong candidate for sensing and control schemes in gravitational wave detector seismic isolation. Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone to nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if left unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper first shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working HoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time correction of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately calibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one of the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational wave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs, suppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal of such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be reconstructed after the fact. We demonstrate all of this on a working HoQI system and show the measured suppression of nonlinear effects from each of these methods. Our work makes HoQIs a more broadly applicable tool for displacement sensing.",

    "abstract": "We present the physical design and systematic optimization of a high-performance storage ring tailored for the generation of high-power coherent radiation, with particular emphasis on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime. The proposed ring adopts a Double Bend Achromat (DBA) lattice configuration and integrates 12 superconducting wigglers to significantly enhance radiation damping and minimize the natural emittance. And a bypass line is adopted to generate high power coherent radiation. Comprehensive linear and nonlinear beam dynamics analyses have been conducted to ensure beam stability and robustness across the operational parameter space. The optimized design achieves a natural emittance of approximately 0.8 nm and a longitudinal damping time of around 1.4 ms, enabling the efficient buildup of coherent radiation. Three-dimensional numerical simulations, incorporating the previously proposed angular dispersion-induced microbunching (ADM) mechanism, further confirm the system's capability to generate high-power EUV coherent radiation, with output powers reaching the order of several hundred watts. These results underscore the strong potential of the proposed design for applications in coherent photon science and EUV lithography.",

    "abstract": "We present a Monte Carlo method for simulating the inception of electric discharges in gases. The input consists of an unstructured grid containing the electrostatic field. The output of the model is the estimated probability of discharge inception per initial electron position, as well as the estimated time lag between the appearance of the initial electron and discharge inception. To obtain these quantities electron avalanches are simulated for initial electron positions throughout the whole domain, also including regions below the critical electric field. Avalanches are assumed to propagate along field lines, and they can produce additional avalanches due to photon and ion feedback. If the number of avalanches keeps increasing over time we assume that an electric discharge will eventually form. A statistical distribution for the electron avalanche size is used, which is also valid for gases with strong electron attachment. We compare this distribution against the results of particle simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate examples of inception simulations in 2D Cartesian, 2D axisymmetric and 3D electrode geometries.",

    "abstract": "Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as particle noise hamper long time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as particle resampling. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space. This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, 3X in physical space and 3V in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a 1X + 1V Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. Stable long time dynamics are demonstrated up to T = 500 and reproducibility artifacts and data with stable dynamics up to T = 1000 are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Caribou is a versatile data acquisition system used in multiple collaborative frameworks (CERN EP R&D, DRD3, AIDAinnova, Tangerine) for laboratory and test-beam qualification of novel silicon pixel detector prototypes. The system is built around a common hardware, firmware and software stack shared accross different projects, thereby drastically reducing the development effort and cost. It consists of a custom Control and Readout (CaR) board and a commercial Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) platform. The SoC platform runs a full Yocto distribution integrating the custom software framework (Peary) and a custom FPGA firmware built within a common firmware infrastructure (Boreal). The CaR board provides a hardware environment featuring various services such as powering, slow-control, and high-speed data links for the target detector prototype. Boreal and Peary, in turn, offer firmware and software architectures that enable seamless integration of control and readout for new devices. While the first version of the system used a SoC platform based on the ZC706 evaluation board, migration to a Zynq UltraScale+ architecture is progressing towards the support of the ZCU102 board and the ultimate objective of integrating the SoC functionality directly into the CaR board, eliminating the need for separate evaluation boards.

    "title": "Coronal hole picoflare jets are progenitors of both fast and Alfvénic   slow solar wind",
    "abstract": "Solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of this wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations reveal intermittent jets, with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to solar wind have not been established. Here, we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft that establish a unified picture of fast and Alfv\\'{e}nic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.",

    "title": "Upgrades of the ATLAS Zero Degree Calorimeter System for Run 3 at the   Large Hadron Collider",
    "abstract": "Experimental studies of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) depend crucially on Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs) that measure neutrons produced at near-beam rapidity in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In hadronic nuclear collisions these neutrons are mainly spectator neutrons, those that do not scatter from opposing nucleons during the collision. As a result, the ZDCs provide a vital probe of heavy ion collision geometry. The ZDCs are also essential in the study of ultra-peripheral collisions that are initiated by photons associated with the electric fields of one or both nuclei. Coherent photon emission typically leaves the photon emitter intact, making the observation of no ZDC signal, on one or both sides, a tag of such processes. The ATLAS ZDCs, built prior to Run 1 were substantially upgraded for LHC Run 3. The primary upgrades included replacement of the quartz Cherenkov radiator with $\\text{H}_2$-doped fused silica rods; installation of fast air-core signal cables between the ZDC and the ATLAS USA15 cavern; new LED-based calibration system; and new electronics implemented for readout and fully-digital triggering. The ZDCs were also augmented with new \"Reaction Plane Detectors\" (RPDs) designed to measure the transverse centroid of multi-neutron showers to allow event-by-event reconstruction of the directed-flow plane in nuclear collisions. The Run~3 ZDC detectors, including the RPDs, are described in detail with emphasis on aspects that are new for Run~3.",

    "title": "Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather   events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation",
    "abstract": "The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.",

    "abstract": "By returning to the topological basics of fusion target design, Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) is used to specify how to initially configure and drive the optimally entangled topological state, and stabilize that topological state from disruption. This can be applied to all methods; including tokamaks, laser-driven schemes, and pulsed-power driven schemes. The result is practical, room temperature targets that can yield up to 10 GJ of energy, driven by as little as 3 MJ of absorbed energy. The genAI is based on the concept of Ubuntu that replaces the Deep Convolutional Neural Network approximation of a functional, with the formula for the generating functional of a canonical transformation from the domain of the canonical field momentums and fields, to the domain of the canonical momentums and coordinates, that is the Reduced Order Model. This formula is a logical process of renormalization, enabling Heisenberg's canonical approach to field theory, via calculation of the S-matrix, given observation of the fields. This can be viewed as topological characterization and control of collective, that is complex, systems.",

    "abstract": "Global gyrokinetic simulations are performed for the first time to investigate cross-scale interactions between electromagnetic ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence and fishbone instability in tokamak plasmas. The investigation of fluctuation response in the multiscale simulation including both instabilities indicates a strong impact of fishbone on ITG turbulence. Detailed analysis reveals that fishbone-driven zonal radial electric fields at nonlinear saturation significantly suppress electromagnetic ITG turbulence, reducing ion thermal transport close to the neoclassical level. The simulation results agree well with experimental observations that turbulence suppression during fishbone bursts. These findings advance understanding of multiscale interactions that enhance thermal confinement in fusion plasmas.",

    "title": "Electromagnetic turbulence in EAST plasmas with internal transport   barrier",
    "abstract": "In this study, global nonlinear electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations are conducted to investigate turbulence in the Internal transport barrier (ITB) region of the EAST tokamak discharge with weakly reversed magnetic shear. Linear simulations reveal two dominant ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes: a higher frequency mode at the $q=1$ surface, which dominates in the electrostatic limit, and a lower frequency mode near the $q_{\\min}$ surface, which prevails under the experimental $\\beta$ (the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure). Finite $\\beta$ effects effectively suppress higher frequency ITG modes, and once $\\beta_i$ on axis exceeds 0.5\\%, this ITG mode is no longer dominant, and the ITG mode near $q_{\\min}$ surface becomes the primary instability. Therefore, electromagnetic effects play a crucial role in stabilizing ITG modes, and in causing the transition between the most unstable mode at different radial positions. The linear growth rate of the unstable mode in the electrostatic limit is approximately 1.25 times higher than that of the dominant mode in the electromagnetic case. However, in the electromagnetic nonlinear regime, the thermal ion heat conductivity is reduced by at least a factor of 4. This reduction primarily results from nonlinear electromagnetic effects enhancing the shearing effect of zonal flows, thereby further suppressing microturbulence. Finally, energetic particles exert a slight stabilizing effect on ITG turbulence due to dilution and finite $\\beta$ contributions. It is emphasized that the electromagnetic effect on ITG with weak magnetic shear should be included to accurately calculate the transport coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Based on a rigorous thermodynamic framework, this work develops a two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic model grounded in the Helmholtz free energy formalism. The model maintains full thermodynamic consistency by simultaneously satisfying energy conservation and entropy production laws in two-fluid systems. By analyzing the convex-concave structure of the Helmholtz free energy density, we systematically derive key thermodynamic variables-chemical potential, entropy density, and internal energy-in a self-consistent manner. Building on this foundation, we construct a temporally discrete numerical scheme that inherits the thermodynamic consistency of the continuous model. The scheme is proven to adhere rigorously to both the first and second laws of thermodynamics. For the implemented two-dimensional degenerate system, we establish comprehensive a priori error estimates in space and time. Numerical simulations validate the model's effectiveness in capturing essential plasma phenomena, demonstrating its applicability to complex physical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We report on R&D study to improve the photon detection efficiency of water Cherenkov detectors by doping ultra-pure water with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a wavelength shifting additive. Cherenkov light yields from cosmic-ray muons were measured for various 4-MU concentrations and compared with those from pure water. At a concentration of 1 ppm, the detected light yield increased by approximately a factor of three. This enhancement can be attributed to wavelength shifting and improved photon collection efficiency. No noticeable degradation in optical transparency was observed across the tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 ppm with different concentration of ethanol. These results suggest that 4-MU is a promising additive for improving the performance of water Cherenkov detectors.",

    "abstract": "Electron microscopy (EM) is a foundational tool for directly assessing the structure of materials. Recent advances in direct electron detectors have improved signal-to noise ratios via single-electron counting. However, accurately counting electrons at high fluence remains challenging. We developed a new method of electron counting for direct electron detectors, Back-Propagation Counting (BPC). BPC uses machine learning techniques designed for mathematical operations on large tensors but does not require large training datasets. In synthetic data, we show BPC is able to count multiple electron strikes per pixel and is robust to increasing occupancy. In experimental data, frames counted with BPC are shown to reconstruct diffraction peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with relatively higher intensity and produce images with improved contrast when compared to a standard counting method. Together, these results show that BPC excels in experiments where pixels see a high flux of electron irradiation such as in situ TEM movies and diffraction.",

    "title": "Modeling of Injected Current Stream-Induced 3D Perturbations in Local   Helicity Injection Plasmas",
    "abstract": "Solenoid-free tokamak startup techniques are essential for spherical tokamaks and offer a pathway to cost reduction and design simplification in fusion energy systems. Local helicity injection (LHI) is one such approach, employing compact edge current sources to drive open field line current that initiates and sustains tokamak plasmas. The recently commissioned Pegasus-III spherical tokamak provides a platform for advancing this and other solenoid-free startup methods. This study investigates the effect of LHI on magnetic topology in Pegasus-III plasmas. A helical filament model represents the injected current, and the linear plasma response to its 3D field is calculated with M3D-C1. Poincar\\'e mapping reveals substantial flux surface degradation in all modeled cases. The onset of overlapping magnetic structures and large-scale surface deformation begins at $\\Psi_{N} \\approx 0.37$, indicating a broad region of perturbed topology extending toward the edge. In rotating plasmas, both single-fluid and two-fluid models exhibit partial screening of the $n = 1$ perturbation, with two-fluid calculations showing stronger suppression near the edge. In contrast, the absence of rotation leads to strong resonant field amplification in the single-fluid case, while the two-fluid case with zero electron rotation mitigates this amplification and preserves edge screening. Magnetic probe measurements indicate that modeling the stream with spatial spreading$-$representing distributed current and/or oscillatory motion$-$better reproduces measured magnetic power profiles than a rigid filament model. The results underscore the role of rotation and two-fluid physics in screening stream perturbations and point to plasma flow measurements and refined stream models as key steps toward improving predictive fidelity.",

This development enables efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium, greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability, extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits on the DSNB flux. With these advances, SK-Gd now stands at the threshold of discovering the DSNB and opens a wide range of new opportunities in astrophysics and neutrino physics.",

    "abstract": "Disturbances in gravitational wave (GW) observational data are often caused by non-stationary noise in the detector itself, such as back-scattering of laser stray light into the signal field. Unlike GW signals, non-stationary noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity and robustness of GW observatories.",

    "title": "Analytical Modeling of Asynchronous Event-Driven Readout Architectures   Using Queueing Theory",
    "abstract": "Event-driven imagers and sensor arrays commonly employ asynchronous arbiter trees with a synchronous acknowledge to serialize requests. We present an analytical framework that models the root as an \\(M/D/1\\) queue with deterministic quantum \\(T\\) and implements losses at the sources through one-slot gating. The admitted rate, loss probability, utilization, and mean sojourn time are coupled by self-consistent relations; a closed form for \\(\\mathbb{E}[S_t]\\) separates fixed path delay \\(\\tau_0\\) from queueing effects. The framework matches post-layout results of a physical prototype over light to heavy traffic, reproducing saturation at \\(1/T\\) and the observed latency growth, while classical \\(M/G/1/K\\) and Engset-type abstractions diverge at higher occupancy. Because all relations are algebraic, they enable rapid sizing at design time, including the impact of partitioning into independent tiles: reducing fan-in lowers arbitration depth and \\(\\tau_0\\), decreases loss, and improves latency at fixed \\(T\\), with throughput adding across tiles. The model thereby links architectural parameters to performance metrics and supports selection of acknowledge period, tiling, and link count under practical constraints.",

Single-pad test structures were irradiated with neutrons over a range of fluence, and post-irradiation performance was characterized. The evolution of leakage current and the calorimetric response of the devices were systematically analyzed as functions of accumulated neutron fluence. In addition, we introduce a simple exponential-annealing model that predicts the time dependence of leakage current after irradiation. The measurements and model together quantify performance degradation and recovery trends, providing guidance for the design and operation of silicon-based calorimetry in harsh radiation environments.",

    "abstract": "Collimation systems in particle accelerators are designed to safely and efficiently dispose of unavoidable beam losses during operation. Their specific roles vary depending on the type of accelerator. The state of the art in hadron beam collimation for high-intensity, high-energy superconducting colliders is exemplified by the system implemented at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this machine, the stored beam energy reaches levels several orders of magnitude higher than the tiny energy required to quench superconducting magnets. It also exceeds by orders of magnitude the damage thresholds of typical accelerator components, placing stringent demands on beam loss control. Collimation systems are therefore essential for the reliable daily operation of modern accelerators. This lecture reviews the design of a multistage collimation system, using the LHC as a case study. The LHC collimation system has achieved unprecedented cleaning performance, with a level of complexity unmatched by any other accelerator. Design aspects and operational challenges of such large-scale collimation systems are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Light dark matter searches using ionization signals in dual-phase liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs) are limited by low-energy ionization backgrounds, including those from the photoelectric effect on the electrodes. To address this, we measured the quantum efficiency (QE) of various electrode materials for vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons in LXe, including platinum (Pt), stainless steel (SUS304), and magnesium fluoride (MgF$_{2}$)-coated aluminum (Al). Our results show that MgF$_{2}$-coated Al exhibits the lowest QE among the tested materials. The QE for VUV photons with a mean wavelength of 179.5~nm was measured to be $(7.2 \\pm 2.3) \\times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a reduction by a factor of 4.4 compared to SUS304, a commonly used electrode material in direct dark matter experiments with LXe. These findings suggest that employing low-QE electrodes can help mitigate photoelectric-induced backgrounds, potentially improving the sensitivity of LXe TPCs in light dark matter searches.",

Following a Monte Carlo study of internal shielding to suppress neutron multiple scattering in T-REX, the neutron transmission and scattering properties of 12 shielding-material samples have been measured at the ISIS spallation neutron source. Neutron transmission was measured on the EMMA beam line at wavelengths 0.5-4.7 A, using a 2D-position-sensitive, neutron GEM detector, while neutron scattering was measured for 6 of the samples at the Merlin spectrometer, at wavelengths 0.72, 1.28, 1.85 and 2.41 A. The present tests show that a B4C/Al composite material, plated with Ni to stop intrinsic alpha background, is an effective neutron absorber, suitable for incorporation in the Multi-Grid structures which detect the neutrons in inelastic neutron spectrometers .",

    "title": "First global gyrokinetic profile predictions of ITER burning plasma",
    "abstract": "In this work, we present the first global gyrokinetic simulations of the ITER baseline scenario operating at 15 MA using GENE-Tango electrostatic and electromagnetic simulations. The modeled radial region spans close to the magnetic axis up to rho_tor = 0.6. Our results show a pronounced density peaking, moderated by electromagnetic fluctuations. The predicted fusion gain for this scenario is Q = 12.2, aligning well with ITER's mission objectives. We further characterize the turbulence spectra and find that electromagnetic modes, such as microtearing modes, kinetic ballooning modes, and Alfvenic ion temperature gradient modes at low binormal wave numbers, play a critical role in the core transport of this ITER scenario, necessitating high numerical resolution for accurate modeling. Local flux-tube simulations qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the global gyrokinetic simulations but exhibit a much higher sensitivity to profile gradients, reflecting increased stiffness, likely due to the linearization of the equilibrium profiles and safety factor. Our study also reveals that the imposed external toroidal rotation profiles have a negligible impact on turbulent transport, as their magnitudes are substantially lower than the dominant linear growth rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the safety factor profile is of paramount importance: scenarios featuring flat q profiles with near-zero magnetic shear lead to the destabilization of kinetic ballooning modes in the plasma core, significantly enhancing turbulent transport and potentially degrading confinement. Finally, although electron temperature gradient turbulence initially appears large, sometimes exceeding ion-scale transport levels, it is ultimately quenched over long timescales by secular evolution of zonal flows, which are weakly damped under the very low collisionality conditions expected in ITER.",

    "abstract": "Radon-induced backgrounds, particularly from $^{222}$Rn and its beta-emitting progeny, present a critical challenge for next-generation liquid xenon (LXe) detectors aimed at probing dark matter down to the neutrino fog. To address this, we developed a compact hermetic gaseous xenon (GXe) detector. This device physically isolates the active volume from external radon sources by using a PTFE vessel sealed between two quartz flanges with mechanically compressed ePTFE gaskets. To quantify radon sealing performance, we implemented a dual-loop GXe circulation system and conducted a 670-hour radon-injection measurement campaign. Radon ingress into the hermetic detector was monitored using electrostatic radon detectors and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). From these two independent measurements, the steady-state ratios of the radon concentrations inside the hermetic detector to those outside were estimated to be $ (1.1 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^{-2} $ and $ (1.1 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{-2} $, corresponding to radon-leakage flows of $ (2.9 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{-11} $ and $ (2.6 \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{-11} $ $ \\thinspace $m$^{3}$ $ \\thinspace $ $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, respectively. An extrapolation to a 60-tonne LXe TPC such as XLZD suggests that the radon leakage could amount to $ 1.2 \\times 10^{-2} $ $ \\thinspace $mBq, which is negligible compared to the expected natural radon emanation inside the detector, typically 3$ \\thinspace $mBq. These results demonstrate that flange-based mechanical sealing provides an effective solution for realizing radon-isolated inner detectors in large-scale LXe experiments.",

    "abstract": "The gamma-ray total absorption facility (GTAF) composed of 40 BaF2 detection units is designed to measure the cross section data of neutron radiation capture reaction online, in order to comply with the experimental nuclear data sheet.We have found that one of the most important sources of experimental background is the initial alpha particles emitted by the BaF2 crystal. Developing data analysis algorithms to eliminate the influence of alpha particles in experimental data has become a key aspect. In this work, in order to meet the needs of data acquisition, online measurement and analysis of neutron radiation cross section, the GTAF data acquisition system adopts a full waveform acquisition method, which results in a large number of data recorded, transmitted, and stored during experiment, which also affects the uncertainty of the cross-section data.Based on the signal waveform characteristics of the BaF2 detection unit, in order to solve the aforementioned problems, three methods, namely the ratio of fast component to total component, pulse width, and time decay constant, are used to identify and distinguish alpha particles and gamma rays. The quality factor FOM is utilized as an evaluation value and several experiments are conducted using three radioactive sources (22Na, 137Cs, 60Co) for verification.",

    "title": "Particle-in-cell simulations of laser crossbeam energy transfer via   magnetized ion-acoustic wave",
    "abstract": "Large magnetic fields, either imposed externally or produced spontaneously, are often present in laser-driven high-energy-density systems. In addition to changing plasma conditions, magnetic fields also directly modify laser-plasma interactions (LPI) by changing participating waves and their nonlonear interactions. In this paper, we use two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to investigate how magnetic fields directly affect crossbeam energy transfer (CBET) from a pump to a seed laser beam, when the transfer is mediated by the ion-acoustic wave (IAW) quasimode. Our simulations are performed in the parameter space where CBET is the dominant process, and in a linear regime where pump depletion, distribution function evolution, and secondary instabilities are insignificant. We use a Fourier filter to separate out the seed signal, and project the seed fields to two electromagnetic eigenmodes, which become nondegenerate in magnetized plasmas. By comparing the seed energy before CBET occurs and after CBET reaches quasi-steady state, we extract CBET energy gains of both eigenmodes for lasers that are initially linearly polarized. Our simulations reveal that starting from a few MG fields, the two eigenmodes have different gains, and magnetization alters how the gains depend on laser detuning. The overall gain decreases with magnetization when the laser polarizations are initially parallel, while a nonzero gain becomes allowed when the laser polarizations are initially orthogonal. These findings qualitatively agree with theoretical expectations.",

    "title": "Non-Gaussian Magnetic Structures in the Small-Scale Turbulent Dynamo",
    "abstract": "The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with polarisation observations.",

    "title": "Relativistic multistage resonant and trailing-field acceleration induced   by large-amplitude Alfvén waves in a strong magnetic field",
    "abstract": "We propose a particle acceleration mechanism driven by large-amplitude Alfv\\'en waves in a strong magnetic field. The acceleration process proceeds through multiple stages triggered by counterpropagating wave-particle resonant acceleration (CWRA) via decay instability. Initially, parent and daughter Alfv\\'en waves resonantly accelerate particles perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The resultant modulational instability generates electrostatic fields within the wave packet, which are locally amplified by the ponderomotive force of the Alfv\\'en wave packet. These fields subsequently drive further acceleration within a few relativistic gyroperiods via gyroresonant surfing acceleration (GRSA). During this, the v*B force facilitates momentum transfer from the perpendicular to the parallel direction. In the later stage, particles become trapped by the parent wave and gain additional energy through single wave resonant acceleration (SWRA). Furthermore, the accumulation of accelerated particles induces electrostatic trailing fields behind and at the tail of the wave packet, which drive trailing-field acceleration (TFA) of other electrons. The combined effects of these mechanisms, CWRA followed by GRSA and SWRA, result in highly relativistic electron energy. The electron energy accelerated through the above process is higher than that accelerated through TFA. This multistage acceleration process provides insights into the generation of high energy cosmic rays in astrophysical environments.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the self-consistent formation and long-term evolution of proton beams in the expanding solar wind using an ensemble of one-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulations. Initial conditions are chosen to represent a range of plasma states observed by the Helios spacecraft at 0.3 AU, including an amplitude-modulated Alfv\\'en wave that nonlinearly drives a proton beam aligned with the magnetic field. We compare simulation results with solar wind data out to 1.5 AU and show that our model reproduces key observed features of proton beams on average, such as the radial evolution of the drift and the relative core-to-beam density ratio. These findings support the theory that the observed evolution of the proton beam drift in the solar wind is determined by kinetic instabilities. More broadly, our results indicate that the interplay between nonlinear Alfv\\'en wave dynamics, expansion effects and kinetic instabilities plays a fundamental role in solar wind dynamics, with implications for interpreting solar wind heating rate estimates.",

    "title": "Characterization of the first full-size production for ePIC TOF layers",
    "abstract": "Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are characterized by a fast rise time (500 ps) and extremely good time resolution (down to 17 ps). The intrinsic low granularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for precise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs factories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. AC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating oxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill factor and charge-sharing capabilities. Charge sharing between electrodes allows a hit position resolution well below the pitch/$\\sqrt12$ of standard segmented detectors. At the same time, it relaxes the channel density and power consumption requirements of readout chips. Extensive laboratory characterization of AC-LGAD devices from the first full-size (up to 3x4 cm) production from HPK for ePIC will be shown in this contribution. Both pixel and strip geometry was produced and tested. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R&D program at the EIC.",

These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical rather than isotopic separation. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.",

In this manuscript the calibration procedures of the SiPMs are described including corrections for the temperature dependence of their light yield. These corrections are needed as the SiPMs are not kept at a constant temperature due to the complexity and cost of implementing a cooling system on such a large detector. Rather, it was decided to monitor the temperature to allow the appropriate corrections to be made. The SiPM temperature dependence has been measured in a dedicated experiment and the calibration procedures were validated with data from production detectors awaiting installation at Fermilab.",

    "title": "Adjustable Low-Cost Highly Sensitive Microwave Oscillator Sensor for   Liquid Level Detection",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the implementation of a low-cost high-precision microwave oscillator sensor with an adjustable input resistance to enhance its limit of detection (LoD). To achieve this, we introduce a \\textit{Z$_{2}$} branch in the input network, comprising a transmission line, a capacitor (\\textit{C$_{B}$}) and a resistor (\\textit{R$_{V}$}). The sensor is tested with eight different liquids with different dielectric constants, including water, IV fluid, milk, ethanol, acetone, petrol, olive oil, and Vaseline. By fine-tuning the \\textit{Z$_{2}$} branch, a clear relationship is found between $\\varepsilon_{r}$ of materials and R$_{V}$.Our experimental results demonstrate outstanding characteristics, including remarkable linearity (nonlinearity < 2.44\\%), high accuracy with an average sensitivity of 21 kHz/$\\mu$m, and an excellent limit of detection (LoD < 0.05 mm). The sensor also exhibits good stability across a range of liquid temperatures and shows robust and repeatable behavior. Considering the strong absorption of microwave energy in liquids with high dielectric constants, this oscillator sensor is a superior choice over capacitive sensors for such applications. We validate the performance of the oscillator sensor using water as a representative liquid. Additionally, we substantiate the sensor's improvement through both experimental results and theoretical analysis. Its advantages, including affordability, compatibility with CMOS and MEMS technologies, and ease of fabrication, make it an excellent choice for small-scale liquid detection applications.",

    "title": "Time-based Selection of Kaonic Atom X-ray Events with   Quasi-Hemispherical CZT Detectors at the DAFNE collider",
    "abstract": "This work presents the results of a time-based event selection for searching X-ray signals from kaonic atom X-ray transition using a single quasi-hemispherical Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) detector at the DA$\\Phi$NE collider. To mitigate the high background level in the measured X-ray spectrum, a dedicated event selection strategy was developed, exploiting the precise timing correlation between e+e- collisions and detector signals. This approach enabled, for the first time, the observation of two characteristic X-ray transitions from kaonic aluminum atoms using a CZT detector: for the 5-4 transition at 50~keV, 362~$\\pm$~41~(stat.)~$\\pm$~20~(sys.) signal events over 1698~$\\pm$~197~(stat.)~$\\pm$~25~(sys.) background events in 5$\\sigma$ were observed, with a resolution of 9.2\\%~FWHM; for the 4-3 transition at 106~keV, 295~$\\pm$~50~(stat.)~$\\pm$~20~(sys.) signal events over 2939~$\\pm$~500~(stat.)~$\\pm$~16~(sys.) background events in 5$\\sigma$ were measured, with a resolution of 6.6 ~FWHM. A strong background suppression of approximately 95\\% of the triggered data was achieved through this time-based selection. The demonstrated timing capability of the CZT detector proved highly effective in isolating time-correlated events within an 80 ns window, setting an important benchmark for the application of these semiconductors in timing-based X-ray spectroscopy. These results highlight the potential of CZT-based detection systems for future precision measurements in high-radiation environments, paving the way for compact, room-temperature X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray spectrometers in fundamental physics and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The determination of experimental sensitivity is a key step in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$), providing a quantitative benchmark for detector design. Two commonly used statistical approaches are the counting method, which estimates sensitivity from the number of events in a predefined region of interest, and the fitting method, which extracts the signal contribution by fitting the full energy spectrum. In this work, we investigate both discovery sensitivity and exclusion sensitivity within these two approaches. Through statistical derivation and simulation verification, we show that the relative performance of the methods depends on both energy resolution and exposure, while at higher exposures the fitting method consistently yields more stringent sensitivity. These results provide guidance for selecting the optimal statistical method in future $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiments.",

    "title": "LEP3: A High-Luminosity e+e- Higgs and ElectroweakFactory in the LHC   Tunnel",
    "abstract": "As stated in the 2019 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), it is of the utmost importance that the HL-LHC upgrade of the accelerator and the experiments be successfully completed in a timely manner. All necessary efforts should be devoted to achieving this goal. We also recall two of the principal recommendations of the 2019 ESPP for future accelerator initiatives, namely that 1) An electron-positron Higgs factory is the highest priority for the next collider (Rec. c). 2) Europe, together with its international partners, should investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with a centre-of-mass energy of at least 100 TeV and with an electron-positron Higgs and electroweak factory as a possible first stage (Rec. e). A major objective in particle physics is always to operate an accelerator that allows a leap of an order of magnitude in the constituent centre-of-mass energy with respect to the previous one. We support FCC-ee and FCC-hh as the preferred option for CERN future, as it addresses both of the above recommendations.   The guidance for the 2025 ESPP requests, in addition to the preferred option, the inclusion of ``prioritised alternatives to be pursued if the chosen preferred option turns out not to be feasible or competitive''. Proposed alternatives to the preferred FCC option include linear, muon colliders and LHeC accelerators. In response to this request we propose reusing the existing LHC tunnel for an electron-positron collider, called LEP3, as a back-up alternative if the FCC cannot proceed. LEP3 leverages much of the R\\&D conducted for FCC-ee, offers high-precision studies of Z, W, and Higgs bosons below the tt threshold, and offers potential physics performance comparable or superior to other fallback options at a lower cost while supporting continued R\\&D towards a next-generation energy frontier machine.",
