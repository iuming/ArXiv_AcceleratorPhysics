  "title": "2DESR: a two-dimensional Fourier-space gyrokinetic eigenvalue code for the ion-temperature-gradient modes in tokamaks",
  "abstract": "A two-dimensional (2D) gyrokinetic eigenvalue solver, 2DESR, has been developed to solve the 2D gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem in the poloidal Fourier space for the ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) modes in tokamaks. With full kinetic effects of ions retained, the 2D gyrokinetic eigenvalue equations in the poloidal Fourier space have been derived and numerically solved in the 2DESR code. In the linear ITG Cyclone test with adiabatic electrons, the 2DESR code benchmarks well against the gyrokinetic initial-value codes GENE and NLT. It is found that two branches of ITG modes coexist in the system.",
