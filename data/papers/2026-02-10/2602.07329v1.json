  "title": "Topological Arrest of Ballooning Modes in Non-Axisymmetric Plasmas",
  "abstract": "Nonlinear ballooning instabilities in non-axisymmetric equilibria exhibit spatial localization along field lines that mirrors Anderson localization in disordered lattices. We demonstrate that this localization fundamentally alters nonlinear stability, transforming a global ballooning crash into a connectivity phase transition on a Ginzburg-Landau network. We identify a dimensionless number, denoted by ηc, as a topological threshold derived from continuum percolation theory. Below this threshold, global instability is topologically arrested as isolated scintillations, providing a rigorous explanation for the robust, benign saturation observed in experiments. Above this threshold, a spanning cluster path forms, unlocking rapid and potentially disruptive nonlinear growth.",
