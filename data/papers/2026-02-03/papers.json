    "title": "Emerging Technologies and Methods in Wide-Area Search for Nuclear Materials",
    "abstract": "Canada, a Tier 1 nuclear nation involved in uranium mining and refining, operating nuclear power reactors, and with a Small Modular Reactor action plan, maintains a rigorous nuclear security infrastructure. The Nuclear Emergency Response team at Natural Resources Canada fulfills federal mandates in high-sensitivity air- and ground-based mobile survey for prevention, detection and response. A robust operational framework exists for deployment of traditional large-volume NaI(Tl)-based detection suites. At the same time, a research arm examines emerging non-nuclear technologies which can enhance the capabilities of the operational team. Herein, the potential for uncrewed mobile systems in nuclear security and emergency response operations is discussed. The impact of new technologies such as silicon photomultipliers, gamma imagers and self-shielding directional detectors is presented, and the use of high-performance computing in modelling of system response functions is discussed. Finally, a capability to extrapolate to the location of a source some distance away from a survey trajectory is shown. The extrapolation method includes propagation of the measurement error to the extrapolated region, essential information for nuclear response operators to know if a region is actually clear of radioactivity or not.",

    "title": "Gamma Imagers for Nuclear Security and Nuclear Forensics: Recommendations based on results from a side-by-side intercomparison",
    "abstract": "Nuclear security operations and forensic investigations require the utilization of a suite of instruments ranging from passive gamma spectrometers to high-precision laboratory sample analyzers. Gamma spectroscopy survey is further broken down into wide-area search performed with large-volume scintillator-based mobile survey spectrometers which are integrated with geographic position sensors for mapping and identification of hot zones, and high-precision long-dwell measurements using solid state spectrometers for follow-on characterization to establish isotopic content and ratios. While performing well at detecting the presence, quantity and type of radioactivity, all of these methods have limited ability to determine the location of a source of radioactivity. In recent years, technology advances have resulted in gamma imager devices which can create an image of the distribution of radioactive sources using the gamma emissions which accompany radioactive decay, and overlay this on an optical photograph of the environment. These gamma imaging devices have arisen out of methods developed for medical physics, experimental particle physics, and astrophysics, resulting in a proliferation of different technological approaches. Those responsible for establishing a nuclear security concept of operations, require guidance to choose the proper gamma imager for each of the application spaces in a tiered response. Here the results of an intercomparison of two gamma imagers based on two widely different technologies, semiconductor and scintillator detectors, are presented. The optimal utilization of these imaging technologies in a tiered response is discussed based on the results of the trial. Finally, an outlook on future directions for gamma imaging advances is provided.",

    "title": "Neutron multiplicity measurement in muon capture on oxygen nuclei in the Gd-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector",
    "abstract": "In recent neutrino detectors, neutrons produced in neutrino reactions play an important role. Muon capture on oxygen nuclei is one of the processes that produce neutrons in water Cherenkov detectors. We measured neutron multiplicity in the process using cosmic ray muons that stop in the gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector. For this measurement, neutron detection efficiency is obtained with the muon capture events followed by gamma rays to be $50.2^{+2.0}_{-2.1}\\%$. By fitting the observed multiplicity considering the detection efficiency, we measure neutron multiplicity in muon capture as $P(0)=24\\pm3\\%$, $P(1)=70^{+3}_{-2}\\%$, $P(2)=6.1\\pm0.5\\%$, $P(3)=0.38\\pm0.09\\%$. This is the first measurement of the multiplicity of neutrons associated with muon capture on oxygen without neutron energy threshold.",

Here, we show that integrating high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference with mobile gamma-ray spectrometry enables rapid and accurate quantification of distributed and point-like gamma-ray sources. Validated against laboratory and field assays, our framework quantifies natural and anthropogenic gamma-ray sources that conventional methods cannot resolve in $1\\,$s with $\\sim\\!\\!1\\,\\%$ error. The developed method marks a critical advance in quantitative gamma-ray sensing, enabling improved radiological situational awareness, enhanced terrestrial geophysical and geochemical mapping, as well as more robust constraints on radionuclide abundances on extraterrestrial bodies across the Solar System.",

Stable pulsed operation requires synchronization of the facility timing system with the Low-Level RF (LLRF) system. The timing system distributes trigger and gate signals to key subsystems, including the DAQ, klystrons, laser systems, pulsed kicker magnets, and interlocks. The LLRF system provides phase-coherent RF references and facility-wide clock distribution for synchronization. Achieving ~100 fs-level synchronization depends critically on the phase-noise power spectral density (PN-PSD) of the distributed clock signals and on preserving this performance throughout the distribution network. We present facility-wide measurements of the KEK ATF LLRF clock PN-PSD and discuss the resulting synchronization floor imposed by the stability of the ATF Linac and Damping Ring signal generators.",

    "title": "Observational Evidence for Wind-Driven Low-Pass Filtering of Infrasound at Short Range",
    "abstract": "Infrasound from controlled explosions provide a unique opportunity to isolate atmospheric effects on propagation. We report observations from two campaigns in May and October 2024, each featuring 10-ton TNT-equivalent controlled surface chemical explosions recorded by a dense network of 31 single-sensor stations within 23 km. Despite identical sources, the observed wavefields were very different. October signals followed a near-unimodal period-distance trend, whereas May signals exhibited a pronounced azimuthal bifurcation in both period and celerity. Downwind paths largely preserved the short-period baseline observed in October, while upwind paths showed systematically longer periods caused by wind-driven low-pass filtering. This study provides the first direct observational evidence that tropospheric winds can impose azimuth-dependent low-pass filtering at local ranges, without the influence of measured temperature inversions. Thus, the structure of the atmosphere can modify the spectral characteristics of low-frequency acoustic waves even at a distance of only a few kilometers.",

    "title": "Inter-detector differential fuzz testing for tamper detection in gamma spectrometers",
    "abstract": "We extend physical differential fuzz testing as an anti-tamper method for radiation detectors [Vavrek et al., Science and Global Security 2025] to comparisons across multiple detector units. The method was previously introduced as a tamper detection method for authenticating a single radiation detector in nuclear safeguards and treaty verification scenarios, and works by randomly sampling detector configuration parameters to produce a sequence of spectra that form a baseline signature of an untampered system. At a later date, after potential tampering, the same random sequence of parameters is used to generate another series of spectra that can be compared against the baseline. Anomalies in the series of comparisons indicate changes in detector behavior, which may be due to tampering. One limitation of this original method is that once the detector has `gone downrange' and may have been tampered with, the original baseline is fixed, and a new trusted baseline can never be established if tests at new parameters are required. In this work, we extend our anti-tamper fuzz testing concept to multiple detector units, such that the downrange detector can be compared against a trusted or `golden copy' detector, even despite normal inter-detector manufacturing variations. We show using three NaI detectors that this inter-detector differential fuzz testing can detect a representative attack, even when the tested and golden copy detectors are from different manufacturers and have different performances. Here, detecting tampering requires visualizing the comparison metric vs. the parameter values and not just the sample number; moreover this baseline is non-linear and may require anomaly detection methods more complex than a simple threshold. Overall, this extension to multiple detectors improves prospects for operationalizing the technique in real-world treaty verification and safeguards contexts.",

    "title": "Monte Carlo simulation of the ISOLPHARM gamma camera for Ag-111 imaging",
    "abstract": "Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT) is a well-established technique for cancer treatment. In this approach, radionuclides are bound to specific drugs that selectively transport them to the tumor site. Within the ISOLPHARM project, a radiopharmaceutical for TRT based on the innovative radionuclide Ag-111 is currently under development. Ag-111 has a half-life of 7.45 days and decays by emitting both electrons and gamma-rays. The emission of gamma-rays, predominantly at an energy of 342 keV, enables the visualization of Ag-111 using a gamma camera. In this work, we describe a Monte Carlo simulation developed to optimize the design parameters of such an imaging device. The simulation is based on the Geant4 toolkit, which accurately models the interactions between particles and matter. The estimated spatial resolution and sensitivity of the system are approximately 4 mm and 19 cps/MBq, respectively. The simulated device is able to resolve lesions with a lesion-to-background activity ratio of 4:1 under in-vivo-like conditions. These results indicate that the proposed gamma camera can provide cost-effective imaging capabilities for preclinical radiopharmaceutical studies.",

    "title": "Time-Resolved Interferometric Measurements of Plasma Density Evolution in Laser-Driven Capacitor-Coil Targets",
    "abstract": "Laser-driven capacitor-coil targets provide a compact platform for generating strong magnetic fields and are widely used in magnetized high-energy-density plasma experiments. In addition to magnetic-field generation, these targets also produce plasma in the coil region, which can influence the subject physical processes, interact with secondary targets or external plasmas in their applications. However, direct, time-resolved measurements of the plasma density surrounding the coil remain limited. Here, we report interferometric measurements of the plasma density evolution in laser-driven capacitor-coil targets irradiated by the University of Osaka LFEX laser. Two-dimensional electron density maps reveal two distinct plasma sources loading the coil region: plasma generated in the coil itself and plasma produced by laser ablation of the target plates. These results provide quantitative information on plasma loading and evolution in capacitor-coil targets and are directly relevant to the design and modeling of magnetized high-energy-density plasma experiments.",

    "title": "Jitter Sensing and Control for Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval",
    "abstract": "The family of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors, such as the curvature and nonlinear curvature wavefront sensors (WFS), contain tip/tilt information embedded in their signals. We have built a nonlinear curvature WFS to study different wavefront reconstruction methods and test the ability to extract tip/tilt information. Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined with knowledge of the measured $z$-distance to each measurement plane, we demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast steering mirror and the WFS in closed loop. This approach obviates the need for peripheral components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging channel. Our laboratory experiments validate tip/tilt estimation and correction using nlCWFS data, achieving tip/tilt accuracy of +/-0.1, lambda/D for an unaberrated beam and better than ~+/-0.5, lambda/D in the presence of aberrations, consistent with prior numerical simulations. We further demonstrate a closed-loop tip/tilt control implementation and show a qualitative improvement in the stability and overall quality of multi-plane phase retrieval reconstructions.",

    "title": "A predictive formula for the H-mode electron separatrix density: Bridging regression and physics-based models across C-Mod, AUG and JET tokamaks",
    "abstract": "The electron density at the separatrix ($n_{e,\\mathrm{sep}}$) plays a central role in balancing energy confinement, detachment achievement, and ELM suppression in tokamaks, thereby influencing core-edge integration. To study what determines this key parameter, a database of H-mode separatrix density measurements from Alcator C-Mod, ASDEX Upgrade, and JET tokamaks has been assembled using a consistent analysis method across all devices. This dataset is used to derive a regression scaling expression based solely on engineering parameters, and the results are compared to predictions from the two-point model. The agreement found is remarkable: both the regression and model provide similar parameter dependencies and tokamak-specific multiplicative constants. Building on this agreement, a fully predictive formula that combines the regression dependencies and the two-point model multiplicative constant is proposed. This formula is able to estimate $n_{e,\\mathrm{sep}}$ across the three machines within a factor of 1.5, and provides projections to next-step devices (ITER, SPARC, DTT, JT-60SA and COMPASS-U) that are in agreement with available SOLPS simulations.",

    "title": "A centimeter-sized gas pressure sensor for high-vacuum measurements at cryogenic temperatures",
    "abstract": "Gas pressure sensors based on nanomechanical membranes have recently demonstrated an ultra-wide ten-decade measurement range, a gas-type-independent response, and a self-calibrating operation with uncertainties of approximately $1\\,\\%$. The readout relied on tabletop free-space laser interferometers. Here we present a centimeter-sized, portable implementation in which a square Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane is read out via a fiber-based laser interferometer. We perform pressure measurements between $5\\times10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1}$~mbar in a confined $0.7$~L volume cooled to $78$~K. Because no suitable commercial pressure sensor exists for direct cryogenic comparison, we benchmark our device against room-temperature commercial gauges connected to the cold volume through a pipe of limited conductance. The measured relationship between the two sensors is compared with models accounting for temperature- and pumping-induced pressure gradients within the measurement chamber. These models agree with the measurements to within $<10\\,\\%$ for helium and $<13\\,\\%$ for nitrogen. The achieved readout sensitivity of $S_x = 8\\times10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ theoretically enables resolving the thermal displacement noise spectrum of a trampoline membrane at atmospheric pressure, with a peak response of $48\\,S_x$ $\\left(25\\,S_x\\right)$ at $295\\,\\mathrm{K}$ $\\left(78\\,\\mathrm{K}\\right)$. Our results suggest that the previously achieved pressure measurement range of ten decades with trampoline membranes is compatible with fiber-based optical readout. This paves the way for widely applicable pressure sensors in the centimeter size range in cryogenic environments.",

    "title": "Bayesian Optimisation of Non-linear Breit-Wheeler Pair Production in Simulated Laser Experiments",
    "abstract": "High laser intensities enable the production of electron-positron pairs from bright gamma rays passing through strong fields. Potentially the most promising approach for all-optical experiments in the near term uses dense but higher divergence electron beams from laser wakefield acceleration to produce gamma rays through inverse Compton scattering. Achieving many-photon collisions between these gamma rays and the high intensity laser pulse in practice is extremely difficult, however, due to significant shot-to-shot jitter in laser pointing and timing.   We model these practical difficulties using simulated Monte-Carlo experiments. By using a more efficient algorithm for sampling infrequent pair production with particle splitting, we enable the exploration of a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using Gaussian Process Regression we then efficiently find optimal conditions for maximising pair production by changing the laser spot size, the energy in the colliding beam, and the stand-off distance between the laser wakefield accelerator and the focus of the colliding laser pulse. We find that the optimal stand-off distance increases with the degree of laser jitter and that the best conditions for producing electron-positron pairs are not the same as the best conditions for maximising the energy in the gamma rays. With \\unit[100]{J} of laser energy, we estimate rates of pair production of around 1 pair per 100 electrons are achievable even with jitter of 10s of microns and 10s of femtoseconds.",

    "title": "High-bandwidth frequency domain multiplexed readout of transition-edge sensors for neutrinoless double beta decay searches",
    "abstract": "The next-generation of cryogenic neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments require increasingly fast readout in order to improve background discrimination. These experiments, operated as cryogenic calorimeters at $\\sim$10 mK, are usually read out by high-impedance neutron transmutation doped (NTD) thermistors, which provide good energy resolution, but are limited by $\\sim$1 ms response times. Superconducting detectors, such as transition-edge sensors (TESs) with a time resolution of $\\sim$100 $μ$s, offer superior timing performance over NTD semiconductor bolometers. To make this technology viable for an application to a thousand or more channels, multiplexed readout is necessary in order to minimize the thermal load and radioactive contamination induced by the readout. Frequency-domain multiplexing readout (fMux) for TESs, previously developed at Berkeley Lab and McGill University, is currently in use for mm-wave telescopes with detector sampling rates in the order of 100 Hz. We demonstrate a new readout system, based on the McGill/Berkeley digital fMux readout, to satisfy the higher bandwidth and noise requirements of the next generation of TES-instrumented cryogenic calorimeters. The new readout samples detectors at 156 kHz, three orders of magnitude faster than its cosmology-oriented predecessor. Each multiplexing readout module comprises ten superconducting resonators in the MHz range and a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), interfaced to high-bandwidth field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based electronics for digital signal processing and low-latency feedback.",

    "title": "Exploring Long-Range Interactions in the Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillations at IceCube DeepCore",
    "abstract": "The IceCube neutrino observatory consists of an array of Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) instrumenting one cubic-kilometer of deep glacial ice at the South Pole. DeepCore, a densely-spaced sub-array of DOMs at the bottom central region of IceCube, enables the detection of atmospheric neutrinos with an energy threshold in the GeV range. The high statistics data of DeepCore provides a unique opportunity to perform neutrino oscillation studies as well as explore various sub-leading Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics signatures. We consider a well-motivated minimal extension of the Standard Model by an additional anomaly-free, gauged lepton-number symmetry, such as $L_e - L_μ$ or $L_e - L_τ$. These symmetries give rise to flavor-dependent long-range interaction mediated through a very light neutral gauge boson. In this contribution, we present the sensitivity of the IceCube DeepCore detector to search for this flavor-dependent long-range interaction potential with a runtime of 9.3 years.",

Neutrinos, however, offer an independent way to explore Earth's interior via matter effects in neutrino oscillations that depend on the electron distribution inside Earth, and hence its matter density.

    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon. This study investigates how well data-driven fully kinetic simulations can reproduce the ion and electron energy distributions observed during a reconnection event by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations initialized with plasma parameters derived from the MMS event and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. Key numerical and physical parameters were systematically varied to assess their influence on the resulting particle spectra. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of nonthermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a more pronounced role in reproducing the observed distributions.We present a novel analysis of data-driven fully kinetic simulations of MR, showing that key aspects of particle acceleration can be captured, while also highlighting the limitations of 2D simulations and the need for more realistic (e.g., 3D) setups to reproduce the observed particle energization accurately.",

    "abstract": "The IceCube detector, using its densely instrumented center, called DeepCore, can detect multi-GeV atmospheric neutrinos. The oscillation pattern of neutrinos is altered due to interactions with ambient electrons as they pass through Earth. The changes in these patterns are influenced by the amount of matter and its specific arrangement. As neutrinos propagate, they retain information about the densities they encounter. Our study demonstrates that IceCube DeepCore can utilize the Earth's matter effects to distinguish between a homogeneous matter density profile and a layered structure density profile of Earth. In this contribution, we present that IceCube DeepCore data equivalent to 9.3 years of observation can reject the homogeneous matter density profile with a confidence level of 1.4$σ$.",

    "title": "Unlocking the Power of Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory to Explore the Electronic Structure Under Extreme Conditions",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in X-ray free-electron laser diagnostics have enabled direct probing of the electronic structure under extreme pressures and temperatures, such as those encountered in stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion experiments, challenging theoretical models for interpreting experimental data. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) has been successfully applied to analyze experimental X-ray scattering measurements, but its high computational cost renders routine application impractical. Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT. We further show that even at temperatures on the order of 100 eV, quantum non-locality remains essential for correctly describing the electronic structure of dense hydrogen.",

    "abstract": "The n2EDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute aims to conduct a high-sensitivity search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Magnetic stability and control are achieved through a combination of passive shielding, provided by a magnetically shielded room (MSR), and a surrounding active field compensation system by an Active Magnetic Shield (AMS). The AMS is a feedback-controlled system of eight coils spanned on an irregular grid, designed to provide magnetic stability to the enclosed volume by actively suppressing external magnetic disturbances. It can compensate static and variable magnetic fields up to $\\pm 50$ $μ$T (homogeneous components) and $\\pm 5$ $μ$T/m (first-order gradients), suppressing them to a few $μ$T in the sub-Hertz frequency range. We present a full finite element simulation of magnetic fields generated by the AMS in the presence of the MSR. This simulation is of sufficient accuracy to approach our measurements. We demonstrate how the simulation can be used with an example, obtaining an optimal number and placement of feedback sensors using genetic algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a detailed investigation of solid-fluid phase coexistence in a bilayer dusty plasma crystal subjected to varying confinement ring bias voltages in a DC glow discharge argon plasma. Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and the associated increase in non-reciprocal interaction strength are strongly correlated with the onset of structural destabilization. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.",

Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.",

The micrometer-scale of the source makes wakefield betatron radiation well-suited for advanced imaging techniques, including diffraction and phase-contrast imaging. Recent progress in laser technology can expand these capabilities into the attosecond regime, where the practical applications would significantly benefit from the increased energy contained within the pulse. Here we use numerical simulations combined with batch Bayesian optimization to enhance the radiation produced by an attosecond betatron source. The method enables an efficient exploration of a multi-parameter space and identifies a regime in which a plasma density spike triggers the generation of a high-charge electron beam. This results in an improvement of more than one order of magnitude in the on-axis time-averaged power within the central time containing half of the radiated energy, compared to the reference case without the density spike.",

    "title": "A Wide Bandwidth Trans-impedance Amplifier for Picosecond-Scale SiPM Characterization in a Wide Temperature Range",
    "abstract": "Future high-energy physics experiments using SiPMs as photosensitive elements may require operation at low temperatures (down to 80 K) to measure single photons with high time resolution in a highly radioactive environment. This calls for a complete characterization of these sensors over a wide temperature range to find the best compromise between detector performance and cooling requirements. This paper presents the design of a transimpedance amplifier featuring high gain ($\\sim 7500$ $\\mathrm{V/A}$), very high speed ($ < 500$ $\\mathrm{ps}$ rise time) and low input noise ($\\lesssim 0.2$ $\\mathrm{pA/\\sqrt{Hz}}$), able to faithfully reproduce all the features of SiPM signals with very low noise and time jitter. These features make the amplifier suitable for precise measurements of the time-of-arrival of single-photon signals, as well as gain and recovery time. This article provides a detailed and thorough analysis of the circuit. The network was simulated and measured in two configurations that differ in their open-loop gain and dominant pole frequencies. After selecting the best configuration for our purposes, the amplifier was characterized in detail at ambient temperature and at 80 K. Finally, we evaluated the amplifier using a SiPM operated at low over-voltage. While SiPMs are typically characterized at high over-voltage to enhance gain and minimize timing jitter, testing at low over-voltage allowed us to assess the amplifier's performance under more challenging and realistic conditions for single-photon timing.",

To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.",

Performance metrics, optimization strategies, and systematic effects are discussed, demonstrating the beamline utility for neutron instrumentation testing. These results establish the extended monochromatic beamline as a useful resource for the development and validation of neutron polarimetry technologies.",

    "abstract": "This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. This work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices.",

    "title": "High-resolution calorimetric sample platforms for cryogenic thermodynamic studies with multimodal synchrotron x-ray compatibility",
    "abstract": "X-ray calorimetric sample platforms combining specific heat and synchrotron x-ray measurements provide a powerful means to investigate fundamental material properties. Calorimeter cell designs featuring a compact heater and thermometer arranged in a sidecar geometry, with the sample positioned directly above the heater at the center of a silicon nitride membrane, are presented. High-yield, wafer-level batch fabrication of precision calorimetric sensor chips, beamline and laboratory cryostat plugins with sensor mounting and packaging are described. Using our calorimetric sensors, we present specific heat measurements on samples with masses ranging from 4 μg to 145 μg. The sample and reference cells are characterized with relaxation and ac steady-state measurements. The thermal response is captured using lock-in detection at carefully optimized measurement frequencies, with phase-lag correction ensuring precise extraction of heat capacity. The reference cell's background heat capacity was measured to be under 320 nJ/K at 300 K, decreasing to just 0.4 nJ/K at 0.7 K. The calorimeter performance is illustrated by studying the specific heat of small samples of superconducting Nb and a 4 μg piece of superconducting Al under different magnetic field strengths. The determination of fundamental thermodynamic quantities from low-temperature electronic and lattice specific heat measurements is discussed. These versatile, high-throughput sample platforms are engineered for small-sample calorimetry across a broad cryogenic temperature range, and they support scalable integration with a wide range of cryostats, including beamline cryostats at the Advanced Photon Source. They accommodate multimodal geometries and enable operation under ultra-high vacuum, millikelvin temperatures, magnetic fields, and x-ray illumination.",

    "abstract": "The first high-power (> 3 MW) H-mode experiments using a double-null X-point-target (XPT) divertor configuration have been performed on MAST-U. The XPT geometry is obtained by combining a large strike point radius, similar to the Super-X divertor (SXD), with an additional X-point near the separatrix in the baffled outer divertor chambers and leads to additional exhaust benefits over the SXD. The broader electron density profile near the secondary X-point leads to additional plasma-neutral interactions, evidenced by a broader hydrogenic emission profile, and resulting in larger power and ion sinks. The increase in plasma-neutral interactions also leads to lower target electron temperatures and heat fluxes. These benefits appear to extend to transients, and preliminary evidence of improved ELM buffering in the XPT is presented. These results showcase how multiple alternative divertor configuration strategies can be combined to improve momentum, power, and particle losses, which may be required for the challenging exhaust conditions of future reactors.",

    "abstract": "A new approach to incorporating coupling elements into a generalized coupled mode theory is presented. The simplest model of coupling of a structured waveguide with an external RF power source and load through loops and transmission lines was used. Even such a simple model significantly complicated the system of coupled equations. It turned into a coupled integro-differential system of the Barbashin type with degenerate kernels. Since the integral kernels are degenerate, this system is reduced to three independent systems of differential equations. Instead of solving a system of coupled integro-differential equations, we need to find solutions to three systems of ordinary differential equations. Two systems describe the distribution of the field excited by one loop and the specified value of the excitation current in it. In the first system the loop is located at the section's input, and in the second, at the section's output. The third system does not depend on the loop parameters at all. It describes the distribution of the field excited by an electron beam in a section without loops. Based on the developed analytical model, the computer code was developed for matching the loop couplers for the uniform accelerating sections of X-band. The calculation results were used to simulate the non-uniform section. Without additional matching, we obtained an input reflection coefficient of 8E-3.",

    "abstract": "We propose a hybrid semi-Lagrangian scheme for the Vlasov--Poisson equation that combines the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) method with the Characteristic Mapping Method (CMM). Both approaches exploit the semi-group property of the underlying diffeomorphic flow, enabling the reconstruction of solutions through flow maps that trace characteristics back to their initial positions. NuFI builds this flow map iteratively, preserving symplectic structure and conserving invariants, but its computational cost scales quadratically with time. Its advantage lies in a compact, low-dimensional representation depending only on the electric field. In contrast, CMM achieves low computational costs when remapping by composing the global flow map from explicitly stored submaps. The proposed hybrid method merges these strengths: NuFi is employed for accurate and conservative local time stepping, while CMM efficiently propagates the solution through submap composition. This approach reduces storage requirements, maintains accuracy, and improves structural properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme and highlight the trade-offs between memory usage and computational cost. We benchmark against a semi-Lagrangian predictor-corrector scheme used in modern gyrokinetic codes, evaluating accuracy and conservation properties.",

Here, oblique high velocity tungsten-on-tungsten mechanical impacts are reproduced in a controlled manner by a two-stage light gas gun shooting system. The strong dependence of the crater characteristics and crater morphology on the incident angle is documented. A reliable empirical damage law is extracted for the dependence of the crater depth on the incident angle.",

    "abstract": "This work conducts a three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to investigate wave generating, time-dependent reconnection around a magnetic null point. A non-periodic perturbation (in the $xz$-plane) triggers oscillatory reconnection (OR) at the 3D null, resulting in a self-sustained oscillation with a constant period $P$. We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfvén wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology.",

    "abstract": "Radio frequency knock out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Excitation signals comprising many betatron sidebands have shown to reduce intensity fluctuations of the extracted beam spill and are used at several facilities. In this contribution, the effect of individual sidebands at different harmonics on the spill quality is systematically studied using efficient noise excitation signals fully covering the respective sidebands. Particle tracking simulations show a clear correlation between the chosen excitation frequency and the spill quality. This relation is attributed to the spectrum of particle motion shortly before their extraction, and an empiric relation between the spectrum, the excitation frequency, and the resulting spill quality is given. Experiments show an additional reduction of pile-up when using higher excitation frequencies. These insights have implications for an optimal design of excitation waveforms and hardware for Knock Out extraction systems.",

We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics.

    "abstract": "Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.",

When operated with deuterons at 1.5 MeV/amu and an anticipated continuous beam current of 5 mA, simulations project that such a system would yield $\\sim$10$^{13}$ neutrons per second using a thin beryllium target. This neutron yield is sufficient, in principle, to support $^{99}$Mo production without the use of highly enriched uranium or reliance on foreign reactors. Simulations and conceptual design studies suggest that the system's beam dynamics could make it a viable pathway toward decentralized, hospital-based isotope generation. The relatively low energy of the deuterons minimizes activation and safety concerns. This work presents the physics motivation, technical design considerations, and projected neutron yields, outlining a pathway from a neutrino-physics prototype to a biomedical isotope production platform.",

    "title": "Compressible Turbulence as a Source of Particle Beams and Ion Bernstein Waves in Collisionless Plasmas",
    "abstract": "We investigate the source of particle beams and ion Bernstein waves in collisionless plasmas using a high-resolution particle-in-cell simulation of compressible turbulence. At magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales, compressible turbulence is damped by transit-time damping, naturally generating suprathermal electrons and proton beams. As the energy cascade reaches sub-ion scales, multiple branches of ion Bernstein waves are excited and contribute to the formation of proton suprathermal tails. Under realistic conditions such as those in the solar wind, these processes remain efficient and provide a natural explanation for the super-Alfvénic proton beams observed in situ. We show that compressive fluctuations, though often understudied, are essential for cross-scale energy transfer and dissipation in collisionless plasma turbulence.",

    "title": "Performance evaluation of an offshore wave measurement buoy in monochromatic waves",
    "abstract": "The accurate measurement of waves underpins marine energy resource characterization, device design, and project development. Datawell wave buoys are widely deployed around the world and have long served as a trusted standard for wave measurements. We quantify the measurement performance, including wave elevation and energy flux estimation, of a Datawell DWR-MkIII buoy using prescribed monochromatic heave motions on a large-amplitude six-degree-of-freedom motion platform at the National Laboratory of the Rockies, assuming the buoy behaves as an ideal wave follower. Commanded motions were validated with an optical motion tracking system while buoy elevation and raw acceleration were recorded. Wave elevations were propagated to wave energy flux estimation using four methods, including one frequency-domain method and three time-domain methods. The Bayesian optimization was applied for design of experiments, and records from three test sites were also applied and evaluated in the present study. Results show two error regions within the nominal period range of 1.6s to 30s}. For wave periods between 5s and 25s, the buoy provides accurate wave height measurements. For short periods less than 5s, the 1.28Hz sampling frequency induces sub-Nyquist artifacts that bias elevation and can drive maximum energy flux estimation errors above 100%. For long periods exceeding 25s, the buoy reported elevation is underpredicted with error depending on period but relatively independent of wave height, with maximum wave height and wave energy flux errors reaching 64% and 87%, respectively. The analysis of field data also indicates that the currently recommended method for estimating wave energy flux may underestimate the wave energy flux.",

First, Monte Carlo methods for an $(r,q)$ distribution that generalizes flattop and kappa distributions are discussed. Then, two rejection methods for the regularized kappa distribution are presented, followed by a comparison in the $κ$ space. A simple recipe is proposed for the subtracted kappa distribution. Properties and numerical recipes for the ring and shell distributions with a finite Gaussian width are discussed. The ring and shell Maxwellians are further introduced as alternatives to the ring and shell distributions. Finally, methods for the super-Gaussian and the filled-shell distributions are presented.",

    "title": "Superelastic Heating in Treanor-Gordiets Plasmas: A Unified Analytic Closure",
    "abstract": "In non-equilibrium plasmas where the vibrational temperature exceeds the gas temperature, conventional harmonic models underestimate superelastic electron heating rates by an order of magnitude or more. This failure stems from the artificial decoupling of energy modes, which ignores the exponential heating contributions from overpopulated high-lying states characteristic of Treanor-Gordiets distributions. We resolve this limitation by deriving a closed-form, thermodynamically consistent anharmonic gain function based on detailed balance and a second-order Dunham expansion. This formulation serves as a unified governing equation that naturally identifies the kinetic crossover between vibrational-vibrational (V-V) up-pumping and vibrational-translational (V-T) relaxation. This approach accurately predicts the Treanor minimum and recovers the accuracy of full state-to-state benchmarks at a fraction of the computational cost. The model provides a robust closure for predicting electron temperature evolution in applications ranging from hypersonic flows to plasma-assisted combustion.",

    "title": "Performance of the Particle-Identification Silicon-Telescope Array Coupled with the VAMOS++ Magnetic Spectrometer",
    "abstract": "The Particle-Identification Silicon-Telescope Array (PISTA) is a new detection system designed for high-resolution studies of the fission process induced by multi-nucleon transfer in inverse kinematics. It is specifically optimized for experiments with the VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer at GANIL (Grand Accélérateur National d'Ions Lourds). The array comprises eight trapezoidal $Δ$E-E silicon telescopes arranged in a corolla configuration. Each telescope integrates two single-sided stripped silicon detectors, enabling target-like recoil identification, energy loss measurements, and trajectory reconstruction. Positioned in close proximity to the target, PISTA's compact geometry achieves high-efficiency tracking of target-like recoils produced in multi-nucleon transfer reactions at Coulomb barrier energies. The spatial segmentation of the array allows precise determination of the mass and charge of the target-like nucleus, and excitation energy of fissioning systems. This work presents the particle identification and excitation energy reconstruction performances for the interactions of $^{238}$U beam with $^{12}$C target. An excitation energy resolution of 870 keV (FWHM) was determined together with mass resolution of 1.1\\% (FWHM). The combination of PISTA and VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer enables unprecedented investigations of the fission process as a function of the excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus, particularly for exotic systems produced in transfer-induced reactions.",

    "title": "Trigger Optimization and Event Classification for Dark Matter Searches in the CYGNO Experiment Using Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "The CYGNO experiment employs an optical-readout Time Projection Chamber (TPC) to search for rare low-energy interactions using finely resolved scintillation images. While the optical readout provides rich topological information, it produces large, sparse megapixel images that challenge real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination.   We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.   Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies. The achieved performance approaches the theoretical limit imposed by the mixture composition and isolates a high-score population with compact, approximately circular morphologies consistent with nuclear recoils.",
