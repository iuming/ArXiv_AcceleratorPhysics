  "title": "Compressible Turbulence as a Source of Particle Beams and Ion Bernstein Waves in Collisionless Plasmas",
  "abstract": "We investigate the source of particle beams and ion Bernstein waves in collisionless plasmas using a high-resolution particle-in-cell simulation of compressible turbulence. At magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales, compressible turbulence is damped by transit-time damping, naturally generating suprathermal electrons and proton beams. As the energy cascade reaches sub-ion scales, multiple branches of ion Bernstein waves are excited and contribute to the formation of proton suprathermal tails. Under realistic conditions such as those in the solar wind, these processes remain efficient and provide a natural explanation for the super-Alfvénic proton beams observed in situ. We show that compressive fluctuations, though often understudied, are essential for cross-scale energy transfer and dissipation in collisionless plasma turbulence.",
