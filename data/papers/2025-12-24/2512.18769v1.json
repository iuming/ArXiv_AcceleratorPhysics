  "title": "Source quantification by mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems: A Bayesian approach",
  "abstract": "Accurately quantifying gamma-ray sources from mobile gamma-ray spectrometry surveys has remained a fundamentally elusive, long-standing inverse problem at the interface of nuclear and computational physics. Here, we present a full-spectrum Bayesian inference framework that resolves this inverse problem by combining high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo template generation with Bayesian inversion. Applying this methodology to airborne measurements benchmarked against laboratory and in-situ ground truths, we demonstrate accurate and robust quantification of both natural and anthropogenic radionuclides under field conditions. By improving activity estimates by an order of magnitude, providing principled uncertainty quantification, and rigorously accounting for overdispersion, this framework opens the way to a more statistically rigorous and physics-informed era of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry, unlocking enhanced inference capabilities in emergency response, environmental monitoring, nuclear security, and planetary exploration.",
