  "title": "A data-driven method to estimate contamination from light ion beam transmutation at colliders",
  "abstract": "Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium, have been proposed as a way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have produced large datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.",
