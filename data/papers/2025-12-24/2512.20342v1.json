  "title": "Design and Modeling of a Simple-Structured Continuously Variable Transmission Utilizing Shape Memory Alloy Superelasticity for Twisted String Actuator",
  "abstract": "Twisted String Actuators (TSAs) are widely used in robotics but suffer from a limited range of Transmission Ratio (TR) variation, restricting their efficiency under varying loads.To overcome this, we propose a novel lightweight, simple-structured Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) mechanism for TSA utilizing Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) superelasticity. The CVT mechanism consists solely of a pair of highly lightweight superelastic SMA rods connecting the ends of twisted strings. These rods deform under external loads, adjusting the inter-string distance to enable continuous TR variation.We develop a comprehensive theoretical model that integrates three critical nonlinearities",
