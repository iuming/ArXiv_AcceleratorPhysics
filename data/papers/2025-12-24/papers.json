    "title": "An Instrument for Physical Vapor Deposition onto Cryo-EM Samples for Microsecond Time-Resolved Cryo-EM",
    "abstract": "Laser flash melting and revitrification experiments have recently improved the time resolution of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to the microsecond timescale, making it fast enough to observe many of the protein motions that are associated with function. The technique has also opened up a new dimension for cryo-EM sample preparation, making it possible to deposit compounds onto a cryo-EM sample while it is frozen, so that upon flash melting, the embedded particles experience an altered environment. For example, we have recently shown that depositing ultrathin silicon dioxide membranes onto a cryo-EM sample causes particles to detach from the interface upon flash melting, removing preferred particle orientation. These experiments also point towards a new strategy for initiating protein dynamics in time resolved experiments by depositing reagents, which will then mix with the sample upon flash melting. Here, we describe an apparatus for physical vapor deposition of compounds onto cryo-EM samples, detailing its design and operation. As a demonstration, we determine that the minimum thickness of silicon dioxide sealing membranes in a laser flash melting experiment is just over two monolayers. We propose that our design can form the basis for an integrated platform for microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM experiments.",

    "title": "Calibration Method of Spacecraft-Inertial Sensor Center-of-Mass Offset for the Taiji Gravitational Wave Detection Mission under Science Mode",
    "abstract": "Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.",

    "title": "Machine Learning Optimization of BEGe Detector Event Selection in the VIP Experiment",
    "abstract": "The VIP collaboration operates a Broad Energy Germanium detector at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory to measure radiation in the few keV to 100 keV range, aiming to search for spontaneous collapse induced radiation and atomic transitions that violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Here we present a machine learning based upgrade for the BEGe detector using an event selection strategy aimed at improving the efficiency in detecting low energy events down to 10 keV. The method employs a denoising autoencoder to suppress electronic and microphonic noises and to reconstruct pulse shapes, followed by a convolutional neural network that classifies waveforms as normal single site or events with anomalies. The workflow was validated on a dataset comprising more than 20000 waveforms recorded in 2021. The classifier achieves a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.99 and an accuracy of 95 percent. Applying this procedure lowers the minimum detectable energy of the final spectrum to approximately 10 keV. It also yields a measurable enhancement in spectral quality, including an improvement of about 14 percent in the signal to background ratio and a reduction of the energy resolution for the characteristic Pb and Bi gamma lines. These developments enhance the sensitivity of the BEGe detector to rare low energy signals and provide a scalable framework for future precision tests of quantum foundations in low background environments.",

    "abstract": "Using the Monte Carlo ray tracing package McStas, we illustrate the possibilities of creating virtual experiments of the neutron spectrometer BIFROST at the European Spallation Source, ESS. With this model, we are able to benchmark BIFROST with respect to expected intensity, $Q$- and energy-resolution. The simulations reproduce the expected resolution behavior and quantify effects that are difficult to capture analytically, including a wavelength-dependent edge enhancement arising from a combination of the long-pulsed source and the pulse-shaping chopper. Furthermore, we present an antiferromagnetic (AF) spin wave simulation, which we use to create realistic datasets at different instrument operation settings. Our virtual experiments focus on realistic dispersive dynamics and illustrate how the virtual experiment approach reveal resolution effects, not easily calculable via analytical models. This demonstrates the crucial role of numerical simulations in the planning of challenging experiments.",

    "title": "Scalable Relay Switching Platform for Automated Multi-Point Resistance Measurements",
    "abstract": "In both research and industrial settings, it is often necessary to expand the input/output channels of measurement instruments using relay-based multiplexer boards. In research activities in particular, the need for a highly flexible and easily configurable solution frequently leads to the development of customized systems. To address this challenge, we developed a system optimized for automated direct current (DC) measurements. The result is based on a 4x4 switching platform that simplifies measurement procedures that require instrument routing. The platform is based on a custom-designed circuit board controlled by a microcontroller. We selected bistable relays to guarantee contact stability after switching. We finally developed a system architecture that allows for straightforward expansion and scalability by connecting multiple platforms. We share both the hardware design source files and the firmware source code on GitHub with the open-source community. This work presents the design and development of the proposed system, followed by the performance evaluation. Finally, we present a test of our designed system applied to a specific case study: the DC analysis of complex resistive networks through multi-point resistance measurements using only a single voltmeter and current source.",

    "title": "Optimizing the interaction geometry of inverse Compton scattering x-ray sources",
    "abstract": "Inverse Compton scattering is developing to be a promising method to generate coherent and tunable x-rays. In this paper we present a theoretical framework to describe an inverse Compton scattering x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between the electron and laser pulse. Importantly the divergence of a tightly focused laser pulse will have a significant impact of the number of scattered x-rays. The parameters of the interaction geometry are optimized for two specific cases: head-on scattering; and a grazing co-propagating interaction angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tight symmetrically focused laser pulse, that balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a grazing angle geometry an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation.",

    "title": "Generation of near GeV protons by tightly focused laser interacting with down-ramp density plasma",
    "abstract": "Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 μm), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 μm). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\\&D facilities as part of a linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer, independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\\&D for advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals, early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the context of CLIC and ILC.",

    "abstract": "We focus on the process of plasma acceleration in the presence of non-negligible thermal effects, wherein a driver of relativistic electrons perturbs a warm neutral plasma and generates a wakefield structure. We study the acceleration process via numerical simulations based on fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions, and also provide systematic comparisons against ground-truth data coming from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The focus of the analysis is on the first electron depletion bubble after the driver, where we provide a detailed characterization of its size and the electromagnetic fields developed inside. Our results are instrumental in determining the correct thermal closure assumption to be used in fluid models for the numerical simulations of plasma acceleration processes, as well as elucidating the corresponding limits of applicability.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a comprehensive characterization of the FERS 5202 front-end readout unit when processing signals from Silicon Photo-multipliers (SiPMs). The readout system's performance is characterized in terms of its charge resolution, dynamic range, and noise performance at the single photoelectron level, which is critical for applications requiring detection of low-light signals such as medical imaging, high-energy physics experiments and photon counting applications. The evaluation encompassed both fundamental performance metrics and practical implementation scenarios using Hamamatsu MPPC devices. This work aims to provide valuable reference data not only for our intended muon radiography application but also for the broader scientific community employing SiPMs in diverse experimental contexts.",

    "title": "Precision Bounds for Characterising Quantum Measurements",
    "abstract": "Quantum measurements, alongside quantum states and processes, form a cornerstone of quantum information processing. However, unlike states and processes, their efficient characterisation remains relatively unexplored. We resolve this asymmetry by introducing a comprehensive framework for efficient detector estimation that reveals the fundamental limits to extractable parameter information and errors arising in detector analysis - the \\emph{detector quantum Fisher information}. Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements.",

    "title": "Verification of the Outer Space Treaty with Cosmic Protons",
    "abstract": "The Outer Space Treaty (OST) was opened to signatures in 1967, and since then 117 countries, including China, the United States, Russia, have become part of it. Among other stipulations the treaty bans the placement of nuclear weapons in outer space. Recently the US government has raised worries that Russia is testing nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) components, with the possibility that it will place a nuclear weapon in space. Such a device, if detonated, would destroy most of the satellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This danger is compounded by the lack of a verification mechanism for the OST. No methodologies of verification have been proposed in the open peer reviewed literature. This study presents a concept and a feasibility study for verifying a satellite's compliance to the OST by observing the neutrons induced by spallation from the $\\sim$GeV protons in the inner Van Allen radiation belts. The calculations show that a 9U CubeSat sized detection platform can identify a thermonuclear weapon from the distance of 4 km in approximately one week of observation. This conceptual study will stimulate and inform future research and development of verification platforms for OST.",

    "abstract": "We apply lessons from fast timing detector R$\\&$D to strategies for initial calibration of large timing arrays at future colliders. Detector R$\\&$D often benefits from detailed information about the sensor and front-end signal (waveform capture) as well as a quality time reference and tracking. On the other hand, the systems for charged particle (MIP) timing under construction for the CERN High Luminosity LHC log only limited information for each timing channel -- usually amplitude and the time of the leading edge. Furthermore the high event rates certainly present a challenge for \\textit{in situ }calibration of the large (compared to intrinsic) time jitter of the leading edge with pulse amplitude -- amplitude walk. In the examples presented here we find a simple linear dependence of walk on the inverse of the pulse slope at threshold for the dynamic range (in amplitude) suitable to charged particle timing. We present a straightforward calibration method for the small variation in the corresponding coefficient from channel-to-channel.",

    "abstract": "We present the optimization and performance characterization of the second-generation Fermilab Constant Fraction Discriminator ASIC (FCFD), designed for the readout of AC-coupled low-gain avalanche detector (LGAD) strip-sensors. The FCFD is explicitly engineered to be insensitive to signal-amplitude variations, thereby removing the need for time-walk correction that is required in other LGAD time-stamping readout ASICs. This updated version, referred to as FCFD1.1, incorporates several enhancements over the first iteration to address key challenges in AC-coupled LGAD front-end design. We outline the primary readout-ASIC design considerations for these applications, describe the methodology used to evaluate critical sensor and system parameters, and summarize the additionally implemented features. Performance measurements using injected charge signals and minimum-ionizing particles in test-beams demonstrate a time resolution of approximately 40 ps and a position resolution of roughly \\SI{15}{\\micro\\meter} when tested with beam particles uniformly over the active area of the sensor.",

    "title": "Hydrogen bonding in water under extreme confinement",
    "abstract": "Fluids under extreme confinement exhibit unique structures and intermolecular bonding, distinct from their bulk analogs, driving innovative applications at the water-energy nexus. Probing confined water experimentally at the length scale of intermolecular and surface forces has, however, remained a challenge. Here, we report direct molecular-level observations of hydrogen bonding in water confined inside individual carbon nanotubes, enabled by in-situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy with nanoscale resolution. Hydrogen bonding is probed via the intramolecular O-H stretching frequency, which serves as a sensitive spectral signature of the local intermolecular bonding environment. Water in larger carbon nanotubes exhibit the bonded O-H vibrations of bulk water, but at smaller diameters, the frequency blueshifts to near the free O-H stretch found in water vapor and hydrophobic surfaces, indicating a highly dispersed, non-H-bonded environment. Theoretical analysis based on quantum vibrational oscillators indicates that enhanced damping rates, corresponding to rapid hydrogen-bond fluctuations, leads the bimodal spectral peaks to merge into a single broad feature, matching the experimental observation. Furthermore, cryogenic experiments provide insights into complex structural phase transitions of confined water. This research reveals the quantum and dynamic nature of hydrogen bonds under confinement and the potential impact of unveiling molecular-level structure and bonding in confined fluids.",

    "title": "Picosecond laser test unit for photosensor characterization at ambient and low temperatures",
    "abstract": "Accurate single photoelectron (SPE) characterization of photosensors is essential for controlling systematic uncertainties in low-light neutrino and dark matter detectors. We present a compact laboratory setup for the characterization of photosensors under controlled, low-light conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate its use with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operated at the SPE-level, using picosecond laser pulses and waveform digitization to determine key PMT properties. Measurements as a function of supply voltage and temperature ($-50^\\circ$C to $+20^\\circ$C) are performed on ET Enterprises 9821(Q)B tubes and a Hamamatsu R9980 assembly, which show exponential gain-voltage behavior and device-to-device variation. Cooling increases the gain by $\\sim 0.1\\,\\%/^\\circ$C, while the transit time spread (TTS) and peak-to-valley ratio (P/V) exhibit no clear temperature dependence. TTS decreases with voltage. Late pulses remain at the percent level and prepulses at the sub-percent level. Cable length affects both apparent gain and TTS. A model-independent, data-driven self-convolution method is introduced to quantify double photoelectron contributions from pulse charge spectra. The procedures provide a reproducible, practice-oriented reference for SPE-level PMT characterization and can be extended to other photosensor types.",

    "title": "Energy transfer from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves",
    "abstract": "Large-amplitude slow-mode waves are commonly observed near Earth's magnetopause. Recent observations show that these waves can occur simultaneously with kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves. The amplitude of the ion acoustic waves is enhanced near the magnetic field peaks of the slow-mode wave, suggesting that the slow-mode waves may drive the generation of ion acoustic waves. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a hybrid simulation using observation-based parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that large-amplitude slow-mode waves generate counter-streaming ion beams, which in turn excite ion acoustic waves and relax the ion beams. Our study reveals a clear energy transfer channel from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves.",

    "abstract": "We present the baseline design of the electron ring collimation system for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The system addresses beam losses in a high-current electron storage ring with superconducting (SC) final-focus magnets and sensitive detectors, where uncontrolled losses can generate heat loads, radiation, and detector backgrounds and damage. The proposed collimation insertion localizes halo particle losses through reducing interaction region beam losses from beam-gas and Touschek scattering by several orders of magnitude while keeping detector backgrounds and cryostat heat loads within acceptable limits. Multi-turn particle tracking simulations show that the collimators do not significantly impact machine acceptance or beam lifetime, and their positions and apertures can be re-optimized for future lattice configurations. Ongoing work includes incorporating crab cavities and solenoid fields into simulations, refining vacuum conditions, and optimizing collimator geometry and materials. This design establishes a robust baseline for the EIC electron ring collimation system and supports continued lattice optimization for machine operations.",

    "title": "Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields",
    "abstract": "Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (> 5σ) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.",

    "abstract": "We present a microchannel plate detector for compact time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) that jointly optimizes the anode geometry and high-voltage AC-decoupling network for electrically floating operation. Undershoot-driven baseline artifacts and pulse broadening are addressed by a time-domain co-design of the anode geometry and decoupling network. The design is validated through a staged workflow that combines full-wave electromagnetic simulations, vector network analyzer measurements, circuit-level transient models, and end-to-end mass spectra. The resulting planar circular patch anode with anode-proximal decoupling confines fields, preserves peak amplitude, and suppresses post-pulse energy, leading to fast settling and minimal baseline wander. We show that the effective high-pass corner set by the decoupling capacitance directly governs undershoot decay and baseline recovery. Measurements in a representative TOF-MS test setup demonstrate waveguide-level pulse fidelity at a fraction of the mass and volume of heritage waveguide-based detectors, with residual ripples in the measured response originating from downstream cable and digitizer terminations rather than the detector itself. By limiting detector-induced temporal broadening and inter-peak baseline coupling, the design supports high mass resolution and dynamic range in miniaturized TOF-MS architectures. Variants of this planar flight-ready architecture are being implemented in several next-generation spaceborne TOF-MS instruments currently under development at the University of Bern.",

    "abstract": "The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $β$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene. Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \\SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $β$-spectrum endpoint of \\SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \\emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \\SI{0.2}{ppm} per \\SI{1}{kV} single board and $\\lesssim$ \\SI{50}{mV} over the \\SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise.

In addition, the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons was enhanced by a factor of two. The electrons are accelerated via the Laser Wake-Field Acceleration mechanism. Particle-in-cell simulations indicate that electrons are injected via the ionization and the downramp injection mechanisms. Our measurements indicate that the demonstrated electron source is a considerable candidate for high dose, Very High Energy Electrons applications, such as radiotherapy.",

    "title": "Generation of near GeV protons by tightly focused laser interacting with down-ramp density plasma",
    "abstract": "Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 μm), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 μm). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.",

The facility is intended to produce high-quality electron beams and to enable future generation of relativistic vortex electrons carrying quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Simulations of a 1.5-cell RF photogun operating at the currently available accelerating gradient of 45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low bunch charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge effects are weak and the transverse emittance is primarily determined by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and the cathode-region solenoid field results in a robust emittance-compensated regime, yielding a final normalized emittance of 3.2 pi mm mrad. To evaluate the prospects for accelerating vortex electron beams, we further model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The simulations show that acceleration to the multi-MeV energy range significantly suppresses free-space wave-packet spreading and preserves the initial OAM structure, indicating that the proposed test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.",

    "title": "Optimal operating parameters for next-generation xenon gas time projection chambers",
    "abstract": "The next-generation of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0νββ$) searches are targeting half-life sensitivities towards 10$^{27}$--10$^{28}$ years. Gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXeTPC) detectors are a technology that may be able to meet this challenge due to their excellent background rejection power, scalability, and energy resolution. This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen.",

    "title": "Precise control of high-frequency ultrasounds in thin crystals for the development of tunable narrowband and directional gamma-ray sources",
    "abstract": "This work presents a complete methodology for the precise characterization of the acoustic field inside crystal-based devices driven by high-frequency ultrasounds towards the generation of tunable narrowband and directional gamma radiation via undulation of ultra-relativistic charged particles. Such gamma-ray sources have long been anticipated by the scientific community, as they promise new powerful tools for the study of high-energy physical phenomena and the development of novel nuclear technologies. In such devices, a piezoelectric transducer induces tens of MHz harmonic waves inside a silicon monocrystal. Ultra-relativistic charged particles traversing the crystal get trapped within the channels formed by the extremely strong electric fields of the acoustically modulated lattice planes, undergoing undulation and emitting gamma radiation. Precise characterization of the acoustic field in the crystal is crucial for the determination of the expected characteristics of the secondarily generated gamma rays. For this purpose, fast laser refraction imaging is used here to image the acoustic waves by exploiting the spatial redistribution of a laser beam optical intensity caused by the acoustic field. A dedicated computational model is developed for the estimation of the spatial distribution of the pressure and lattice deformation inside the crystal. This methodology provides a framework for future novel gamma-ray sources in high-energy facilities.",

    "title": "Optical parametric free-electron--photon quantum interaction",
    "abstract": "Optical parametric processes underpin quantum photonics, while free-electron--photon interactions offer agile pathways to generate nontrivial quantum photonic states. These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schrödinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons.",

    "title": "Magnetically confined charged particles: From steep density profiles to the breaking of the adiabatic invariant",
    "abstract": "This study examines the stability of Vlasov equilibrium solutions for magnetically confined plasmas, derived through the principle of maximum entropy. By treating the toroidal limit as a perturbation from an analytical cylindrical solution, we demonstrate that these equilibria align well with the inviscid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description. Using the aspect ratio as a perturbation parameter, we compute particle trajectories sampled from the kinetic equilibrium distribution, confirming the overall stability of the solutions. However, under burning plasma conditions, chaotic dynamics emerge for particles with supra-thermal and even thermal energies. This destroys the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment. The exact consequences are unclear, but they could undermine the foundational assumptions of gyrokinetic modelling in burning plasmas. Nevertheless, these results suggest the possibility of unaccounted transport losses in future burning plasma operations. The interplay between turbulence and energetic particles in the presence of Hamiltonian chaos certainly warrants further investigation.",

Employing a novel hydrodynamic model that self-consistently captures nonlinearities from electric, magnetic, and convective interactions with a minimal set of material parameters. The coupled hydrodynamic-Maxwell equations are solved via finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of laser-induced carriers and THz emission. The results reveal strong, tunable THz output dependent on laser (intensity, polarization, incidence angle), material (composition, carrier density, temperature), and struc-tural (layer thickness, substrate) parameters. These predictions offer verifiable guidelines for experiments and position MXenes as versatile platforms for compact, broadband THz sources in on-chip photonics and 6G communications.

    "title": "Design, simulation and performance of the resistive-anode PICOSEC Micromegas detector",
    "abstract": "The PICOSEC Micromegas detector is a Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detector concept developed to achieve tens of picosecond timing resolution for charged particle detection by combining a Cherenkov radiator with a two-stage Micromegas amplification structure. To improve operational robustness, a resistive anode has been implemented using a DLC layer deposited on a Kapton substrate. While this design enhances detector stability, the resistive layer may influence rate capability, signal formation, and detector capacitance, altering timing performance.   This work presents a comprehensive study of a resistive design, including an analytical model and finite-element simulations to quantify rate-dependent gain reduction due to ohmic voltage drop on the resistive layer. An analytical solution for the voltage across a finite-size resistive layer is derived, and a numerical model is developed to evaluate gain suppression under intense particle fluxes. The impact of the resistive layer on signal formation is investigated using time-dependent weighting fields and the Garfield++ simulation framework. The contribution of signal components induced by the resistive layer is quantified, and preservation of the signal leading edge is found for surface resistivities above 100 kohm per square.   Single-channel resistive-anode prototypes were designed, constructed, and experimentally characterized. Laboratory measurements using single photoelectrons and power spectral density analysis show the predicted reduction in signal amplitude while preserving the leading edge. Muon beam tests with CsI and DLC photocathodes demonstrate a time resolution of 11.5 ps for CsI, comparable to 11.9 ps for the metallic-anode device, showing the suitability of the resistive design for precision timing applications.",

    "title": "Reactive near-field subwavelength microwave imaging with a non-invasive Rydberg probe",
    "abstract": "Non-invasive microwave field imaging--accurately mapping field distributions without perturbing them--is essential in areas such as aerospace engineering, biomedical imaging and integrated-circuit diagnostics. Conventional metal probes, however, inevitably perturb reactive near fields: they act as strong scatterers that drive induced currents and secondary radiation, remap evanescent components and thereby degrade both accuracy and spatial resolution, particularly in the reactive near-field regime that is most relevant to these applications. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\\unboldmath$λ/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration. Our results therefore establish a general, non-invasive route to high-accuracy, subwavelength reactive near-field microwave imaging, with particular promise for applications such as chip-defect detection and integrated-circuit diagnostics, where even small perturbations by the probe can mask the underlying physics of interest.",

    "abstract": "The non-inductive current start-up by multi-harmonic electron cyclotron wave has been systematically investigated in the EXL-50U spherical torus. Significant enhancements of the driven current with increasing number of resonance layers have been demonstrated by variation of the number of harmonic resonance layers of the ECW through adjustment of the magnetic field or plasma cross section. The critical role of multi-harmonic ECW in enhancing the driven current has been experimentally verified for the first time. To explain the related experimental observations, a physical mechanism involving multi-harmonic heating, multiple reflections, and multi-pass absorption - leading to the generation of high-energy electrons via X-mode wave or electron Bernstein wave has been proposed. The current drive capacity of the first harmonic extraordinary mode of the ECW has also been experimentally confirmed for the first time. After the application of Ohmic heating during the current ramp-up phase, the current drive efficiency of ECW is further enhanced. Leveraging the synergistic effect between ECW and Ohmic heating, EXL-50U achieved a plasma current of 1 MA, with the non-inductively driven current fraction reaching 70%.",

    "title": "Reconnection-driven Flares in M87*: Proton-Synchrotron-powered GeV Emission",
    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5%-20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.",

    "abstract": "In this letter, we investigate the population of energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves (SAWs) using more than 20 years of data provided by the Wind spacecraft near 1 au. We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

    "abstract": "Modern experimental platforms such as particle accelerators, fusion devices, telescopes, and industrial process control systems expose tens to hundreds of thousands of control and diagnostic channels accumulated over decades of evolution. Operators and AI systems rely on informal expert knowledge, inconsistent naming conventions, and fragmented documentation to locate signals for monitoring, troubleshooting, and automated control, creating a persistent bottleneck for reliability, scalability, and language-model-driven interfaces. We formalize semantic channel finding-mapping natural-language intent to concrete control-system signals-as a general problem in complex experimental infrastructure, and introduce a four-paradigm framework to guide architecture selection across facility-specific data regimes. The paradigms span (i) direct in-context lookup over curated channel dictionaries, (ii) constrained hierarchical navigation through structured trees, (iii) interactive agent exploration using iterative reasoning and tool-based database queries, and (iv) ontology-grounded semantic search that decouples channel meaning from facility-specific naming conventions. We demonstrate each paradigm through proof-of-concept implementations at four operational facilities spanning two orders of magnitude in scale-from compact free-electron lasers to large synchrotron light sources-and diverse control-system architectures, from clean hierarchies to legacy environments. These implementations achieve 90-97% accuracy on expert-curated operational queries.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for comprehensive electrode quality assurance. The system is built around the GRANITE (Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes) facility: a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.   We developed a coaxial wire scanning head to measure and correlate localized high-voltage discharge currents in air with high-resolution surface images. We find that the identified discharge 'hotspots' are transient and show no significant correlation with static visual features. Next, we established a quantitative relationship between artificially induced abrasive surface damage on the wires and a reduction in the discharge inception voltage. This work provides a novel non-invasive tool for qualifying wires dedicated for use in electrodes for future low-background experiments.",

    "title": "The Choice of Line Lengths in Multiline Thru-Reflect-Line Calibration",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis and rigorous procedure for determining the optimal lengths of line standards in multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration of vector network analyzers (VNAs). The solution is obtained through nonlinear constrained optimization of the eigenvalue problem in multiline TRL calibration. Additionally, we propose a simplified approach for near-optimal length selection based on predefined sparse rulers. Alongside the length calculation, we discuss the required number of lines to meet bandwidth requirements. The sensitivity of the proposed procedure is evaluated numerically via Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that the derived lengths have lower uncertainty than those from existing industry standards. Practical examples are provided for various applications, including lossy and dispersive lines, as well as banded solutions for waveguides.",

    "title": "Study of the impact of fast ions on core turbulence at rational surfaces via global gyrokinetic simulations",
    "abstract": "In this work, the interplay between fast ions and safety factor rational surfaces is studied in a turbulent plasma via global nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. Initially, the fast particles-induced enhancement of shearing structures from turbulence self-interaction is analyzed. Our study takes into account the competition between this mechanism and other fast ions effects, i.e. thermal profiles dilution and quasi-resonant interaction. We find the fast ions-induced reduction of destabilization threshold for the zonal modes to be a very efficient way to suppress turbulence. Indeed, it leads to the formation of regions where turbulent transport is reduced by 90\\% of its original value. Furthermore, an $n=m=1$ fishbone is driven unstable inside the plasma and its interaction with turbulence is studied. We find the beat-driven zonal structure generate by this mode to further reduce turbulence when its presence does not drastically flatten the thermal profiles.",

    "title": "A data-driven method to estimate contamination from light ion beam transmutation at colliders",
    "abstract": "Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium, have been proposed as a way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have produced large datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the conceptual design of a spatially-resolved spectroscopy system of Thomson scattering with high wavelength resolution capable of measuring the shape of electron velocity distribution functions in magnetically confined plasmas. We design a spatially-resolved spectrometer with 2560 wavelength channels. The estimated number of scattered photons in a single spectrometer channel is much larger than unity under the experimental setup and plasma parameters of the Compact Helical Device (CHD), indicating sufficient photon statistics for single-shot measurements. Simulations of the scattered spectra show that the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 5 even under the most unfavorable conditions expected in CHD at full spectral resolution, and further improves with post-processing pixel binning. Bayesian inference applied to the simulated spectra demonstrates that the inferred plasma parameters agree with the input values within the estimated uncertainties. Comparisons between spectra generated from non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions and their Maxwellian fits indicate that deviations from Maxwellian distributions can be identified using the proposed system.",

Unlike previous tracer-based models, our simulations reveal a transition to non-diffusive dynamics for a range of charge states.

This finding underscores the nontrivial role of particle inertia in impurity dynamics and has strong implications for impurity control in future fusion devices.",

The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at longer wavelengths. The impact of the environmental refractive index was studied by immersing the EJ-160II fiber in water. Immersing the fiber in water reduced the overall light output and suppressed the short attenuation component, which can be explained by reduced light-collection efficiency due to the smaller refractive-index contrast between the fiber cladding and the surrounding medium.",

Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near-real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions. Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The methodology presented is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of space-charge effects on electron emission typically makes some assumption of continuity and smoothness, whether this is continuity of charge as in the classical derivation of the Child-Langmuir current, or the mean-field approximation used in particle-in-cell simulations. However, when studying the physics of electron emission and propagation at the mesoscale it becomes necessary to consider the discrete nature of electronic charge to account for the space-charge effect of each individual point charge. In this paper we give an extensive analysis of some previous work on the distribution of electrons under space-charge limited conditions. We examine the spacing of electrons as they are emitted from a planar surface, We present simplified models for analysis of such conditions to derive scaling laws for emission and compare them to computer simulations.",
