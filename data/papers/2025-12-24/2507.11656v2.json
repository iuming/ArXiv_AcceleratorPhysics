  "title": "Terahertz Wave Generation in Two-Dimensional MXenes under Femtosecond Pulsed Laser Illumination",
  "abstract": "The efficient generation of terahertz (THz) waves in two-dimensional (2D) MXene layers driven by near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses is demonstrated through predictive simulations. Employing a novel hydrodynamic model that self-consistently captures nonlinearities from electric, magnetic, and convective interactions with a minimal set of material parameters. The coupled hydrodynamic-Maxwell equations are solved via finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of laser-induced carriers and THz emission. The results reveal strong, tunable THz output dependent on laser (intensity, polarization, incidence angle), material (composition, carrier density, temperature), and struc-tural (layer thickness, substrate) parameters. These predictions offer verifiable guidelines for experiments and position MXenes as versatile platforms for compact, broadband THz sources in on-chip photonics and 6G communications. This work establishes a robust, self-contained framework for modeling ultrafast nonlinear optics in 2D materials.",
