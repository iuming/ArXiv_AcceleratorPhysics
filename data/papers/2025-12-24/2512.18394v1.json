  "title": "Nondiffusive transport of inertial heavy impurities in drift-wave turbulence",
  "abstract": "We investigate the transport behavior of tungsten impurities with finite inertia in drift-wave turbulence using the Hasegawa-Wakatani model. Unlike previous tracer-based models, our simulations reveal a transition to non-diffusive dynamics for a range of charge states. This novel mechanism offers a turbulence-driven route to core impurity accumulation. This finding underscores the nontrivial role of particle inertia in impurity dynamics and has strong implications for impurity control in future fusion devices.",
