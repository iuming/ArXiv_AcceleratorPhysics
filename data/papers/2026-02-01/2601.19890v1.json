  "title": "Detecting Solenoidal Plasma Turbulence via Laser Polarization Rotation",
  "abstract": "Recent theoretical studies suggest that solenoidal turbulence can significantly enhance fusion reactivity, yet no standard diagnostic exists to directly measure these solenoidal flows in high-energy-density plasmas, nor to distinguish between solenoidal and compressional turbulence. We propose a method that directly diagnoses the energy and spatial structure of this rotational turbulence using the cross-polarization scattering of a probe laser. By coupling to the plasma vorticity, the scattering generates a cross-polarized signal proportional to the turbulent vorticity, effectively acting as a calorimeter for shear flows. We identify a diffractive scattering signature analogous to ``Debye-Scherrer ring'' that reveals the eddy size distribution. We show that this technique is applicable to National Ignition Facility (NIF) implosion conditions and other high-energy-density scenarios.",
