  "title": "Comment on \"Monochromatization interaction region optics design for direct s-channel Higgs production at FCC-ee\"",
  "abstract": "The original article [1] can be logically divided into two parts: 1) the selection of main parameters for monochromatization and 2) interaction region optics design; the comment pertains only to the first part. The authors of [1] state that \"The purpose of this paper is to report on the development of realistic IR optics designs for monochromatization at the FCC-ee\". However, the proposed parameters do not seem very realistic and raise many questions; due to space limitations, we will only consider the most important ones.",
