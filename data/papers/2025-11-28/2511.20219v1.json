  "title": "Evaluating a Transition-jump System for the Fermilab Main Injector Using Xsuite",
  "abstract": "We describe an Xsuite simulation framework for the Fermilab Main Injector (MI) along with an evaluation of transition-crossing behaviors in the accelerator. In particular, we studied the introduction of quadrupole magnets into the lattice as part of a transition-jump system that will be implemented through the $2^{nd}$ Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II). Simulated beam losses spurred by transition-induced instabilities were assessed under several systematic effects, including MI quad errors, magnet-to-magnet variability in the jump magnets, power-supply errors, and timing jitter.",
