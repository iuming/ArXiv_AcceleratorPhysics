    "title": "Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs",
    "abstract": "Persistent single-electron emission (\"hot spots\") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.",

    "title": "Feasibility of proton bunch compression in an operational high-power   accelerator",
    "abstract": "A muon collider (MC) would require a high-power proton driver to generate intense muon beams at the start of the accelerator chain. Like other high-power facilities, the driver would accumulate intense proton bunches via charge-exchange injection from a linac into a ring. However, unlike other facilities, the MC would require an extreme longitudinal compression of the bunch. We aim to experimentally study the proposed compression scheme at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), which boasts a world-leading proton bunch intensity. In this paper, we describe the operating parameters of the SNS compared to the MC design, the capabilities of the current RF system, and the available beam diagnostics in the SNS accumulator ring. We also present initial simulations and experiments to judge the feasibility of the proposed research.",

    "title": "Polarized Emission of Intrabinary Shocks in Spider Pulsars from Global   3D Kinetic Simulations",
    "abstract": "In spider pulsar systems, a relativistic intrabinary shock forms when the pulsar wind collides with the massive outflow driven off the pulsar's low-mass stellar companion. The shock is a site of non-thermal particle acceleration, likely via shock-driven magnetic reconnection, and produces synchrotron emission. These shocks are among the few systems in which global scales can be reasonably captured with kinetic simulations, enabling first-principles particle acceleration and emission studies. We perform the first global 3D kinetic simulations of spider pulsar intrabinary shocks and predict their polarized emission properties. We report emission spectra, light curves, and polarization patterns as a function of the stripe-averaged magnetic field, cooling strength, and viewing inclination. At $90^\\circ$ inclination and for a low stripe-averaged magnetic field, we reproduce the double peaked light curve observed in spider systems. We predict a significant polarization degree $\\gtrsim15\\%$, which monotonically increases with the stripe-averaged field strength. Our results can be applied to and tested by forthcoming X-ray polarization observations of spider pulsars.",

    "abstract": "The simulation of turbulence in the boundary region of a tokamak is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of fusion reactors. In this work, the use of low-rank linear algebra techniques is shown to enhance the efficiency of boundary simulations, specifically by accelerating the solution of a kinetic model for the neutral particles. Solving the kinetic model deterministically using the method of characteristics requires the solution of integral equations, which typically result in dense linear systems upon discretization. We employ hierarchical matrix approximations to significantly reduce the computational cost of assembling and solving the linear systems, leading to substantial savings in both time and memory. The hierarchical matrix method is implemented and tested within the GBS simulation code for boundary simulations, achieving over 90\\% reduction in computation time and memory, and enabling simulations with unprecedented spatial resolution for neutral particles.",

    "title": "Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting   electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend",
    "abstract": "Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective time-domain data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with 50 dB of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment that is seven times more expensive, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency (200 MHz vs. 80 MHz).",

    "abstract": "Experiments on ADITYA-U tokamak show a marked enhancement in the sawtooth period by application of short gas puffs of fuel that cause a modification of the radial density profile. A consequent suppression of the trapped electron modes (TEMs) then leads to an increase in the core electron temperature. This slows down the heat propagation following a sawtooth crash, causing a delay in achieving the critical temperature gradient inside the q = 1 surface required for the next sawtooth crash to happen. The overall scenario has strong similarities with the behavior of sawtooth under electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH). Our findings suggest an alternate, simpler technique for sawtooth control that may be usefully employed in small/medium-sized tokamaks that do not have an ECRH or any other auxiliary heating facility.",

    "abstract": "Detectors in next-generation high-energy physics experiments face several daunting requirements, such as high data rates, damaging radiation exposure, and stringent constraints on power, space, and latency. To address these challenges, machine learning in readout electronics can be leveraged for smart detector designs, enabling intelligent inference and data reduction at-source. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer a variety of benefits for front-end readout; an on-sensor encoder can perform efficient lossy data compression while simultaneously providing a latent space representation that can be used for anomaly detection. Results are presented from low-latency and resource-efficient VAEs for front-end data processing in a futuristic silicon pixel detector. Encoder-based data compression is found to preserve good performance of off-detector analysis while significantly reducing the off-detector data rate as compared to a similarly sized data filtering approach. Furthermore, the latent space information is found to be a useful discriminator in the context of real-time sensor defect monitoring. Together, these results highlight the multifaceted utility of autoencoder-based front-end readout schemes and motivate their consideration in future detector designs.",

    "abstract": "We study a rain-powered energy-harvesting device inspired by the natural impact of raindrops on leaves. In nature, a raindrop striking a leaf at high speed causes it to deform and vibrate. Inspired by this, our device uses an elastic beam coupled with a piezoelectric material to convert mechanical vibrations from droplet impacts into electrical energy. We conduct experiments to analyze how beam length, droplet impact location, and residual droplet mass affect energy conversion. Our results, supported by a theoretical model, show strong agreement when the beam length exceeds 5 cm. Beyond this length, the energy conversion becomes independent of further increases, suggesting that 5 cm is optimal for maximizing output. To validate practical applicability, we also test the device under real rain conditions, demonstrating consistent performance. Understanding the interplay between raindrop dynamics and energy conversion can guide the design of efficient, scalable rain-powered energy-harvesting systems for environmental applications.",

    "title": "A 3D segmented Water-based Liquid Scintillator for high-precision   detection of neutrinos in water",
    "abstract": "Precision detection of neutrino-nucleus interactions in water with the complete detection of the final state, including leptons and hadrons, is challenging due to water being a non-scintillating medium. This can be a limitation for the next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, where the neutrino-nucleus interaction models must reach a few percent-level accuracy. Water-based liquid scintillator can be a game changer for the future near detectors. In this article, we propose a novel design consisting of a 3D highly-segmented water-based liquid scintillator. The water-based liquid scintillator is encapsulated within a highly-segmented rigid but very light structure that provides the optical isolation with a 1 cm$^{3}$ granularity, each read out by orthogonal wavelength shifting fibers, and 81\\% of water by mass in the active volume. Such configuration is also suitable for pure liquid scintillator. The detector design, prototyped and validated with cosmic ray data, is described and results are reported. The optical model is studied with Monte Carlo simulations and results are compared with the collected data.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, as dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, due to their continuous position measurement of the end mirrors. Speedmeter configurations, which measure mirror velocity rather than position, have been proposed as a means to suppress quantum back-action noise, but practical implementations remain at an early stage. In this work, we present a table-top realisation of the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Speedmeter concept, employing an optical readout scheme based on two orthogonal polarisation modes that probe the interferometer with different effective bandwidths. Using a triangular cavity, we demonstrate that the differential optical response between the linear p- and s-polarised modes exhibits a speed-like frequency dependence: vanishing at DC and increasing linearly with signal frequency, up to the bandwidth of the slower mode. With this we show that an optical system equivalent to the EPR Speedmeter indeed performs a velocity readout of the end mirror.",

The typical design goals are to avoid the pre-field of the charges and to suppress secondary electron emission, while retaining the capability of bunch-by-bunch measurements. In this contribution, a novel FFC design manufactured using additive manufacturing, e.g. laser powder bed fusion is presented and compared with a traditionally produced FFC. The design considerations, RF characterization, and selected measurements with ion beam at GSI are shown.",

    "abstract": "Preformed plasma channels are essential for guiding high-power laser pulses over extended distances in laser wakefield accelerators, enabling the generation of multi-GeV electron beams for applications such as free-electron lasers and particle colliders. Above-threshold ionization heating provides a robust mechanism for creating laser-matched plasma channels across a wide parameter range, owing to its density- and geometry-independent heating effect. Establishing predictive scaling laws between channel parameters and formation conditions is critical for designing channels optimized for electron acceleration across energies spanning hundreds of MeV to tens of GeV. Through combined timescale analysis and numerical simulations, hydrodynamic expansion is identified as the dominant mechanism governing density profile evolution during ATI channel formation. Remarkably, this process maintains effective laser-guiding channel structures across a wide range of initial gas density, as evidenced by the persistent profile similarity observed despite these significant parameter variations. For parabolic channels matched to Gaussian laser drivers, rigorous scaling laws are established that, the on-axis density scales linearly with the initial gas density, while the matching radius has an exponential dependence on both the initial gas density and the ionization laser radius. These findings provide a systematic framework for the predictive design and optimization of plasma channels in high-efficiency and high-energy LWFA applications.",

    "title": "The DeepFMKit Python package: A toolbox for simulating and analyzing   deep frequency modulation interferometers",
    "abstract": "Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) is an emerging laser interferometry technique for high-precision metrology, offering picometer-level displacement measurements and the potential for absolute length determination with sub-wavelength accuracy. However, the design and optimization of DFMI systems involve a complex interplay between interferometer physics, laser technology, multiple noise sources, and the choice of data processing algorithm. To address this, we present DeepFMKit, a new open-source Python library for the end-to-end simulation and analysis of DFMI systems. The framework features a high-fidelity physics engine that rigorously models key physical effects such as time-of-flight delays in dynamic interferometers, arbitrary laser modulation waveforms, and colored noise from user-defined $1/f^\\alpha$ spectral densities. This engine is coupled with a suite of interchangeable parameter estimation algorithms, including a highly-optimized, parallelized frequency-domain Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) for high-throughput offline analysis, and multiple time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementations for real-time state tracking, featuring both random walk and integrated random walk (constant velocity) process models. Furthermore, DeepFMKit includes a high-throughput experimentation framework for automating large-scale parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo analyses, enabling systematic characterization of system performance. DeepFMKit's modular, object-oriented architecture facilitates the rapid configuration of virtual experiments, providing a powerful computational tool for researchers to prototype designs, investigate systematic errors, and accelerate the development of precision interferometry.",

    "title": "High-Fidelity Data-Driven Dynamics Model for Reinforcement   Learning-based Control in HL-3 Tokamak",
    "abstract": "The success of reinforcement learning (RL)-based control in tokamaks, an emerging technique for controlled nuclear fusion with improved flexibility, typically requires substantial interaction with a simulator capable of accurately evolving the high-dimensional plasma state. Compared to first-principle-based simulators, whose intense computations lead to sluggish RL training, we devise an effective method to acquire a fully data-driven simulator, by mitigating the arising compounding error issue due to the underlying autoregressive nature. With high accuracy and appealing extrapolation capability, this high-fidelity dynamics model subsequently enables the rapid training of a qualified RL agent to directly generate engineering-reasonable actuator commands, aiming at the desired long-term targets of plasma configuration. Together with a surrogate model for Equilibrium Fitting code based on neural network, named EFITNN, the RL agent successfully maintains a 400-ms, 1 kHz trajectory control with accurate waveform tracking of plasma current and last closed flux surface on the HL-3 tokamak. Furthermore, it also demonstrates the feasibility of zero-shot adaptation to changed triangularity targets, confirming the robustness of the developed data-driven dynamics model. Our work underscores the advantage of fully data-driven dynamics models in yielding RL-based trajectory control policies at a sufficiently fast pace, an anticipated engineering requirement in daily discharge practices for the upcoming ITER device.",

    "title": "Pump with broadband probe experiments for single-shot measurements of   plasma conditions and crossed-beam energy transfer",
    "abstract": "A novel technique for measuring plasma conditions using monochromatic pump-broadband probe laser interactions has been experimentally demonstrated. Originally proposed in [J. Ludwig et al., Phys. Plasmas \\textbf{26}, 113108 (2019)], this method utilizes crossed-beam energy transfer between the broadband probe and the pump, mediated by plasma ion acoustic waves. The complete energy transfer spectrum can be captured in a single shot, enabling the inference of plasma parameters such as density, electron and ion temperatures, and flow velocity. Compared to Thomson scattering, this technique offers signal enhancements typically larger than 9 orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the required probe laser intensity and facilitating interactions that are linear and measurements that are non-perturbative of the plasma. Furthermore, it provides a powerful tool for advancing studies of crossed-beam energy transfer under conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments.",

    "abstract": "Plasma-based acceleration of positrons attracts extensive interests due to the ultrahigh accelerating gradient and ultrashort duration, while generating wakefield positron beam by the inherent injection is still a great challenge. Here, we put forward a superponderomotive injection method of positrons in the blowout regime of laser wakefield acceleration. In this method, transverse laser fields facilitate the trapping of positrons into the laser-modulated longitudinal wakefield which dominates the subsequent energy gaining, that is distinct from the electrostatic induced superponderomotive electrons. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this method can be implemented by the collision between a donut wake and a pair jet, resulting in the multi-cycle positron beam with hundreds of pC charge and brightness of $10^{13}~\\rm{Am}^{-2}$. Such a collisional setup is available in the current laser-plasma experiments, and the generated positron beam is favorable for developing next generation of electron-positron collider, modeling the laboratory astrophysics and performing the ultrafast material diagnostics research.",

    "abstract": "In particle physics experiments, identifying the types of particles registered in a detector is essential for the accurate reconstruction of particle collisions. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), the GlueX experiment performs particle identification (PID) by setting specific thresholds, known as cuts, on the kinematic properties of tracks and showers obtained from detector hits. Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons and boosted decision trees. Similar approaches have been applied in other particle physics experiments and offer an opportunity to increase PID accuracies using reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that both MLPs and BDTs can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo (MC) simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.",

    "title": "Bridging the Gap between Collisional and Collisionless Plasma Shocks: A   Simulation Study using OSIRIS",
    "abstract": "Shock waves in plasmas can be characterized by the mechanisms behind their formation. When binary collisions are frequent, dissipation is collision-driven and the shock width is a few mean free paths. In contrast, collisionless shocks rely on collective plasma processes to establish dissipation on scales well below the mean free path. We bridge these regimes with particle-in-cell simulations using OSIRIS with a Coulomb-collision module, varying parameters that control collisionality. We find a smooth transition of the shock width in the intermediate region where the ion plasma parameter $N_D \\approx 1$. Our results recover the asymptotic predictions: a collisional-regime width consistent with the Mott-Smith ansatz with a BGK operator, and the collisionless limit consistent with Tidman's classical formalism. The ion plasma parameter thus serves as a practical metric for identifying when shocks shift from fluid-like, mean-free-path scales to collisionless, sub-mean-free-path scales. We discuss implications for astrophysical environments, where shock breakout changes the shock width and marks the onset of efficient particle acceleration.",

Using a few-cycle (~9 fs), multi-terawatt laser pulse and ionization injection in a helium-nitrogen gas mixture, we observe electron spectra composed of multiple quasi-monoenergetic peaks with regular narrow energy spacing. This comb structure arises from intermittent injection from successive half-cycles of the laser field, enabled by the evolving carrier-envelope phase during propagation in the plasma.

We systematically investigate how the material (Li through Au) and size (50-200 nm) of nanoparticles influence electron injection dynamics and beam charge. Our results demonstrate that beam charge (10-600 pC) can be effectively controlled by adjusting these parameters. We identify a saturation threshold in the nanoparticle electric field strength, beyond which beam charge depends on the total number of atoms in the nanoparticle rather than on the electron density after ionization. Significant electron injection occurs across multiple plasma wave periods with distribution patterns influenced by nanoparticle properties leading to increased beam charge but a broader energy spread. These findings offer practical guidelines for experimental implementation of nanoparticle-assisted injection in laser wakefield accelerators to tailor electron beam characteristics for various applications.",

    "title": "Probing ultrafast heating and ionization dynamics in solid density   plasmas with time-resolved resonant X-ray absorption and emission",
    "abstract": "Heating and ionization are among the most fundamental processes in ultra-short, relativistic laser-solid interactions. However, capturing their spatiotemporal evolution experimentally is challenging due to the inherently transient and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) nature. Here, time-resolved resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy, in conjunction with simultaneous X-ray absorption imaging, is employed to investigate such complex dynamics in a thin copper wire driven by an optical high-intensity laser pulse, with sub-picosecond temporal resolution. The diagnostic leverages the high brightness and narrow spectral bandwidth of an X-ray free-electron laser, to selectively excite resonant transitions of highly charged ions within the hot dense plasma generated by the optical laser. The measurements reveal a distinct rise-and-fall temporal evolution of the resonant X-ray emission yield-and consequently the selected ion population-over a 10 ps timescale, accompanied by an inversely correlated x-ray transmission. In addition, off-resonance emissions with comparable yields on both sides of the XFEL photon energy are clearly observed, indicating balanced ionization and recombination rates. Furthermore, experimental results are compared with comprehensive simulations using atomic collisional-radiative models, PIC, and MHD codes to elucidate the underlying physics. The comparison reveals that typical models overestimate the plasma heating under the extreme conditions achieved in our experiment, highlighting the requirement for improved modeling of NLTE collisional processes for predictive capabilities. These results are of broad interest to the high-energy-density science and inertial fusion energy research, both as an experimental platform for accessing theoretically challenging conditions and as a benchmark for improving models of high-power laser-plasma interactions.",

    "abstract": "Superfluid helium-3 bolometers can be utilised for dark matter direct detection searches. The extremely low heat capacity of the B phase of the superfluid helium-3 at ultra-low temperatures offers the potential to reach world leading sensitivity to spin dependent interactions of dark matter in the sub-GeV/c$^2$ mass range. Here, we describe the development of bolometry using both micron scale and sub-micron diameter vibrating wire resonators, with a SQUID amplifier-based readout scheme. Characterisation of the resonators and bolometer measurements are shown, including the use of non-linear operation and the corresponding corrections. The bolometer contains two vibrating wire resonators, enabling heat injection calibration and simultaneous bolometer tracking measurements. Coincident events measured on both vibrating wire resonators verify their response. We also demonstrate proof of concept frequency multiplexed readout. Development of these measurement techniques lays the foundations for the use of superfluid helium-3 bolometers, instrumented with vibrating nano-mechanical resonators, for future low threshold dark matter searches.",

    "abstract": "With the aid of COMSOL multiphysics simulations, a compact microwave plasma reactor operated at 2.45 GHz frequency has been designed for diamond film deposition. The reactor consists of a cylindrical cavity that resonates in the fundamental mode $TM_{01p}$ with a longitudinal field variation (p = 1). Investigations on microwave electric field and hydrogen $(H_{2})$ plasma characteristics inside the microwave plasma cavity have been carried out, which assisted in the resonant cavity optimizations. The new reactor design includes a unique antenna structure which facilitates better thermal management and gas inlet arrangement. Parametric analysis of the effect of increase in microwave power, gas pressure and synergistic effects of power and pressure variations on the $H_{2}$ plasma characteristics such as electron density, gas temperature, and atomic hydrogen density have been performed computationally to estimate the optimize reactor operating conditions. Observations from our simulations indicate that the cavity design is able to operate within a range of microwave power and gas pressure upto $P_{in}=6$ kW and $p_{0}=30$ kPa respectively. Preliminary experimental validation which includes vacuum integrity and $H_{2}$ plasma ignition tests inside the cavity are also reported.",

    "title": "Extracting a stochastic model for predator-prey dynamic of turbulence   and zonal flows with limited data",
    "abstract": "Understanding the interaction between turbulence and zonal flows is critical for modeling turbulence transport in fusion plasmas, often described through predator-prey dynamics. However, traditional deterministic models like the Lotka-Volterra equations simplify this interaction and fail to capture the small fluctuations in simulation data. In this study, we develop a neural network model based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to represent the predator-prey dynamics using limited data from simulations of the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system. We extract the drift and diffusion terms via neural networks, incorporating physical constraints and employing the unscented transform to mitigate challenges brought by limited data. The model accurately reproduces key dynamical features, including stagnation phenomena and energy exchange mechanisms, and the state density distribution generated from the model shows a low KL divergence with the simulation data. A parameter scan reveals that zonal flow shearing efficiency decreases with amplitude, and predator-prey oscillations damp in the absence of stochasticity. These findings underscore the value of integrating physical insight into data-driven approaches for complex plasma systems.",

    "title": "Measurements and TCAD simulations of innovative RSD and DC-RSD LGAD   devices for future 4D tracking",
    "abstract": "This paper summarizes the beam test results obtained with a Resistive Silicon Detector (RSD) (also called AC-Low Gain Avalanche Diode, AC-LGAD) pixel array tested at the DESY beam test facility with a 5 GeV/c electron beam. Furthermore, it describes in detail the simulation results of DC-RSD, an evolution of the RSD design. The simulations campaign described in this paper has been instrumental in the definition of the structures implemented in the Fondazione Bruno Kessler FBK first DC-RSD production.   The RSD matrix used in this study is part of the second FBK RSD production, RSD2. The best position resolution reached in this test is sigma_x = 15 micron, about 3.4% of the pitch. DC-RSD LGAD, are an evolution of the AC-coupled design, eliminating the dielectric and using a DC-coupling to the electronics. The concept of DC-RSD has been finalized using full 3D Technology-CAD simulations of the sensor behavior. TCAD simulations are an excellent tool for designing this innovative class of detectors, enabling the evaluation of different technology options (e.g., the resistivity of the n+ layer, contact materials) and geometrical layouts (shape and distance of the read-out pads).",

In this experiment, a fast-flowing plasma impacts a pulsed magnetic dipole embedded within LAPD's magnetized ambient plasma, creating an ion-scale magnetosphere and driving electron-only magnetic reconnection between the background and dipole field lines. The electron velocity distribution is measured across the reconnection region using non-collective Thomson scattering, enabling determination of electron temperature and density. Significant electron heating is observed in the electron diffusion region, increasing from an initial temperature of 1.8 eV to 9.5 eV, corresponding to a 40\\% conversion of Poynting flux into electron enthalpy flux. Particle-in-cell simulations that provide insights into the heating mechanisms are also presented.",

    "abstract": "The Plasma Liner Experiment (PLX) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is a platform that seeks to achieve fusion via a concept known as Plasma-Jet-Driven Magneto-Inertial Fusion (PJMIF). The experiment consists of three main phases: (1) target formation in which up to four plasma guns shoot magnetized hydrogen or deuterium-tritium jets to form a quasi-spherical target, (2) liner formation in which a constellation of 36 guns fire high-atomic number (e.g., xenon) jets to form a liner shell, and (3) target compression in which the formed liner implodes the pre-formed target. Each phase of the PLX probes different plasma regimes with different physics at play, thus we simulated each phase separately and with multiple codes. Here we highlight some of the 1D, 2D, and 3D simulation results of all three phases from the FLASH, OSIRIS, and HELIOS codes. Some of the key physical processes involved include shock dynamics, kinetic effects, anisotropic thermal conduction, resistive magnetic diffusion, radiation transport, and magnetized jet dynamics. Our simulations show that the PLX can form a preheated (~40 eV), magnetized (electron Hall parameter >1) target plasma, and a quasi-collisional liner shell that can subsequently compress the target to fusion-relevant conditions (e.g., temperatures >1 keV).",

    "title": "Exploring the fusion power plant design space: comparative analysis of   positive and negative triangularity tokamaks through optimization",
    "abstract": "The optimal configuration choice between positive triangularity (PT) and negative triangularity (NT) tokamaks for fusion power plants hinges on navigating different operational constraints rather than achieving specific plasma performance metrics. This study presents a systematic comparison using constrained multi-objective optimization with the integrated FUsion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) framework. Over 200,000 integrated design evaluations were performed exploring the trade-offs between capital cost minimization and operational reliability (maximizing $q_{95}$) while satisfying engineering constraints including 250 $\\pm$ 50 MW net electric power, tritium breeding ratio $>$1.1, power exhaust limits and an hour flattop time. Both configurations achieve similar cost-performance Pareto fronts through contrasting design philosophies. PT, while demonstrating resilience to pedestal degradation (compensating for up to 40% reduction), are constrained to larger machines ($R_0$ $>$ 6.5 m) by the narrow operational window between L-H threshold requirements and the research-established power exhaust limit ($P_{sol}/R$ $<$ 15 MW/m). This forces optimization through comparatively reduced magnetic field ($\\sim$8T). NT configurations exploit their freedom from these constraints to access compact, high-field designs ($R_0 \\sim 5.5$ m, $B_0$ $>$ 12 T), creating natural synergy with advancing HTS technology. Sensitivity analyses reveal that PT's economic viability depends critically on uncertainties in L-H threshold scaling and power handling limits. Notably, a 50% variation in either could eliminate viable designs or enable access to the compact design space. These results suggest configuration selection should be risk-informed: PT offers the lowest-cost path when operational constraints can be confidently predicted, while NT is robust to large variations in constraints and physics uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Issues of tokamak power plants, such as maximum possible length of a pulse of fusion power, the required time between fusion pulses, and the evolution of the current profile towards disruptive states, are tightly constrained by a simple evolution equation for the magnetic field. This equation follows from Faraday's Law and the mathematical relation between the magnetic and the electric fields. The validity of detailed simulations is tested by consistency with Faraday's Law, not the other way around. The evolution equation suggests methods of avoiding the limitations of these constraints. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is proceeding on a fast timescale to operate a fusion power plant -- even writing contracts on the power to be produced by their ARC tokamak. This makes it important to determine the issues that should be studied by SPARC, which is the tokamak that CFS is building to address issues before ARC is built. The STEP prototype of a spherical tokamak power plant in the United Kingdom is on a similar fast timescale. Feasible simulations from startup to shutdown for prototype plasmas could greatly clarify these constraints and the feasibility of their avoidance. This paper has two purposes: (1) Illustrate issues on which research must be focused for the credibility tokamak power plants. (2) Encourage thought on the allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.",

We specify in detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval, all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window.

    "title": "Analysis of Atomic Charge State and Atomic Number for VAMOS++ Magnetic   Spectrometer using Deep Neural Networks and Fractionally Labelled Events",
    "abstract": "The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is a multi-parametric system that integrates ion optical magnetic elements with a multi-detector stack. The magnetic elements, along with the tracking and timing detectors and the trajectory reconstruction method, provide the analysis of the magnetic rigidity, the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer, and the related velocity and mass-over-charge ratio. The segmented ionization chamber provides the energy measurements necessary to analyze the atomic charge state and atomic number. However, this analysis critically suffers from inherent limitations due to the variable thickness and non-uniformity of the entrance window of the ionization chamber and other detector imperfections. Conventionally, this meticulous, detailed analysis is exceptionally tedious, often requiring several months to complete. We present a novel method utilizing deep neural networks, trained on an experimental dataset with only a small fraction of precisely labeled events for the lowest and best-resolved atomic charge states or numbers. This innovative approach enables the networks to autonomously and accurately classify the remaining events. This method drastically accelerates the acquisition of high-resolution atomic charge state and atomic number spectra, reducing analysis time from months to mere hours. Crucially, by discarding human bias, this approach ensures standardized, optimal, and reproducible results with unprecedented efficiency.",

    "title": "The XENONnT Dark Matter Experiment",
    "abstract": "The multi-staged XENON program at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso aims to detect dark matter with two-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers of increasing size and sensitivity. The XENONnT experiment is the latest detector in the program, planned to be an upgrade of its predecessor XENON1T. It features an active target of 5.9 tonnes of cryogenic liquid xenon (8.5 tonnes total mass in cryostat). The experiment is expected to extend the sensitivity to WIMP dark matter by more than an order of magnitude compared to XENON1T, thanks to the larger active mass and the significantly reduced background, improved by novel systems such as a radon removal plant and a neutron veto. This article describes the XENONnT experiment and its sub-systems in detail and reports on the detector performance during the first science run.",

    "abstract": "A hyperbolic system approach is proposed for robust computation of anisotropic diffusion equations that appear in quasineutral plasmas. Though the approach exhibits merits of high extensibility and accurate flux computation, the monotonicity of the scheme for anisotropic diffusion cases has not been understood. In this study, the discrete maximum principle (DMP) of the hyperbolic system approach is analyzed and tested in various anisotropic diffusion cases. A mathematical analysis is conducted to obtain an optimal condition of an arbitrary parameter to guarantee the DMP, and numerical experiments reveal an adoptive selection of the parameter for DMP-preserving results. It is confirmed that, with an appropriate preconditioning matrix and parameter choice, the hyperbolic system approach preserves the DMP even with a linear discretization.",

This entails finding exact constants of motion, valid in the nonperturbative regime, that agree with Kruskal's adiabatic invariant series to all orders in the perturbative regime, when the field scale length is large compared with a typical gyroradius. We demonstrate that the nonperturbative guiding center model makes exact predictions in these cases, even though it eliminates the cyclotron timescale, thereby establishing a theoretical baseline for performance of the nonperturbative formalism.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the S\\\"{a}ntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between Category A and B upward positive lightning pulses and the \"Classical\" and \"Narrow\" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest common physical mechanisms underlying both upward and downward lightning initiation processes, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.",

Bang, {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{111}, 055002 (2013).] using the Texas Petawatt laser beam. The Coulomb explosion of deuterium clusters is simulated based on the particle-in-cell model in a box system with periodic boundary conditions, and fusion reactions are incorporated through the stochastic method. As long as the deuteron numbers in deuterium clusters follow a log-normal distribution, the low-energy part of the final deuteron spectrum can be fitted by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, while there are more deuterons in the intermediate- and high-energy region compared to a thermal distribution, and dominate the weighted yield ratio. Therefore, the effective temperature extracted from the weighted yield ratio is generally higher than that from fitting the final deuteron spectrum. The local density fluctuation, which intrinsically exists due to the log-normal distribution of deuteron numbers, further enhances hot deuteron-deuteron collisions, and significantly affects the weighted yield ratio.",

    "title": "The Enhancement of Ion Heating in Kinetic, Anti-Parallel Reconnection in   the Presence of a Flow Shear",
    "abstract": "We investigate the kinetic effects of upstream, magnetic field-aligned, flow shear on anti-parallel magnetic reconnection using 2.5D Particle-In-Cell simulations. Our results demonstrate that flow shear significantly alters the reconnection process, leading to enhanced ion heating, reduced outflow speeds, and a modified reconnection geometry. In contrast to previous Hall Magnetohydrodynaic (MHD) studies, we find that reconnection becomes a more efficient plasma heating mechanism in the presence of sub-Alfv\\'enic flow shear, with ion heating increasing by as much as 300\\%. This enhanced heating is achieved by efficiently converting the incoming flow shear energy into thermal energy through istropization in the exhaust. The enhanced heating leads to a pressure gradient away form the x-line exerting a force that reduces the outflow jet speed and slows down the reconnection process. This conversion is due to beam selection effects, mixing and scattering in the exhaust. A theoretical model is developed which predicts well the exhaust heating and outflow speed reduction. These results offer a potential explanation for recent Parker Solar Probe observations of suppressed reconnection in the presence of flow shear and carry significant implications for energy dissipation in turbulent plasmas.",

    "abstract": "The construction of the High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) has been completed, with current efforts focused on subsystem commissioning. Beam commissioning is scheduled for autumn 2025, marking a critical milestone in the HIAF project. This paper presents high-precision optics calculations for the Booster Ring (BRing) of HIAF, a key component for achieving stable heavy-ion beam acceleration. Leveraging high-precision magnetic field data, each magnet is divided into hundreds of slices, thus establishing a high-precision sliced optics model for BRing. Detailed calculations of BRing's optics are presented in this work. Critical parameters including tunes and betatron functions of the lattice based on the measured magnetic fields and those of the ideal lattice have been compared. The results highlight the impact of realistic magnetic field on beam dynamics and provide essential insights for accelerator tuning and optimization. These findings serve as a fundamental reference for beam commissioning and long-term operation, ensuring beam stability and performance reproducibility in HIAF.",

    "abstract": "The temporal resolution of MeV ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is fundamentally constrained by the electron bunch length at the sample, motivating the development of new electron sources capable of producing femtosecond scale bunches. In this work, we propose a multicell RF photogun that has a tailored phase velocity profile to generate 5 to 15 fs rms MeV electron bunches directly from the electron gun, eliminating the need for downstream compression. This approach achieves comparable performance to conventional one and a half cell photoguns with downstream compression, while reducing system size, complexity, and power requirements. We examine two implementations: a standing wave (SW) and a travelling wave (TW) design. The TW variant demonstrates over an order of magnitude lower power dissipation than typical SW structures, enabling potential kHz operation. When paired with SwissFEL style C band RF sources, which offer high amplitude and phase stability, the TW photogun is projected to deliver a temporal resolution of 26 fs rms.",

    "title": "On the stability analysis of astrophysical cooling functions",
    "abstract": "To model the temperature evolution of optically thin astrophysical environments at MHD scales, radiative and collisional cooling rates are typically either pre-tabulated or fit into a functional form and then input into MHD codes as a radiative loss function. Thermal balance requires estimates of the analogous heating rates, which are harder to calculate, and due to uncertainties in the underlying dissipative heating processes, these rates are often simply parameterized. The resulting net cooling function defines an equilibrium curve that varies with density and temperature. Such cooling functions can make the gas prone to thermal instability (TI), which will cause departures from equilibrium. There has been no systematic study of thermally unstable parameter space for nonequilibrium states. Motivated by our recent finding that there is a related linear instability, catastrophic cooling instability, that can dominate over TI, here we carry out such a study. We show that Balbus' instability criteria for TI can be used to define a critical cooling rate, $\\Lambda_c$, that permits a nonequilibrium analysis of cooling functions through the mapping of TI zones. We furthermore extend Balbus' criteria to account for thermal conduction. Upon applying a $\\Lambda_c$-based stability analysis to coronal loop simulations, we find that loops undergoing periodic episodes of coronal rain formation are linearly unstable to catastrophic cooling instability, while TI is stabilized by thermal conduction.",
