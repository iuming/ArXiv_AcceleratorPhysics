  "title": "Cold Neutron Imaging and Efficiency Measurements with a Boron-10 Coated Double-GEM Detector",
  "abstract": "A B-10 coated GEM neutron detector (BGEM) was developed as a He-3 free alternative for cold-neutron beamline instrumentation, employing a single B4C converter cathode, a double-GEM amplification stage, and an orthogonal strip readout over an active area of 10 x 10 cm^2. Performance was evaluated at the Bio-REF cold-neutron beamline of the HANARO research reactor using a monochromatic 4.5 {\\angstrom} beam (En = 4.03 meV). The absolute detection efficiency, measured relative to a calibrated Li-6 based Ce:LiCAF scintillation detector, was εBGEM = 8.69 +/- 0.20 % (stat.). The spatial resolution was estimated from the edge smearing of reconstructed images of 1 mm diameter Cd-mask holes via an error-function fit to the radial edge profile, yielding approximately 700 μm. These results demonstrate stable cold-neutron operation of a single converter BGEM detector and provide a baseline for further efficiency improvements via converter and geometry optimization.",
