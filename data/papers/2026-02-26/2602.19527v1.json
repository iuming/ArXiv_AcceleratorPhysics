  "title": "Friction-induced scale-selection in the extended Cahn-Hilliard model for zonal staircase",
  "abstract": "In this work, we describe a possible mechanism to set the radial scale of zonal flows, which may be applicable to the $E \\times B$ staircase found in the global full-f simulations such as [G. Dif-Pradalier et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 085004 (2015)]. 1D numerical simulation results of the Cahn-Hilliard model - extended to include zonal flow friction - can be understood from a heuristic nonlinear analysis. The staircase step-size $Δ$ is found to decrease as the dimensionless zonal flow friction $μ$ increases. It scales like $Δ\\sim \\log μ^α$, with $α\\simeq -0.41$, up to a constant offset.",
