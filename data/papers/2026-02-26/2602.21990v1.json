  "title": "Proof-of-principle experiment of a novel beam extraction over millions of turns using stable resonance islands and bent crystal",
  "abstract": "A recent study [1] has introduced an advanced method aimed at extracting from a circular particle accelerator over millions of turns using stable islands and a bent crystal. This technique leverages the strength of non-linear beam dynamics along with adiabatic trapping and transport within stable islands, in combination with a bent silicon crystal, to provide an efficient extraction of hadron beams over millions of turns. The positive and encouraging results of the comprehensive numerical simulations were validated through a successful proof-of-principle experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron, which demonstrated the feasibility of the technique. This paper presents a detailed discussion and analysis of the experimental results.",
