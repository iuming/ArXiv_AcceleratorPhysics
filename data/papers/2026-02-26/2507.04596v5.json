  "title": "On Topology of Perturbed Vortices",
  "abstract": "Zero-helicity vortices, such as Hill's vortex and field-reversed configurations (FRCs), have long been assumed to be toroidal in topology. This paper proves this assumption false: even under arbitrarily small odd-parity (with respect to the z-axis of symmetry) perturbations, flux surfaces in the interior region become simply connected in topology with crescent-shaped boundaries. A new inner separatrix emerges, separating toroidal flux surfaces in an intermediate region from simply connected surfaces in the core. In a spherical vortex with perturbations at roughly 10% of the background field strength, the simply connected region occupies ~40% of the total closed-field-line volume. The analysis rigorously proves the conjecture regarding field-line closure under odd-parity perturbations in a full three-dimensional context, completing previous partial proofs in two-dimensional geometry. Preliminary numerical simulations of charged particle trajectories in field-reversed configurations revealed crescent-shaped drift surfaces even for small gyroradii. Given that FRCs are sustained by rotating magnetic fields with odd parity, these results motivate a revision of FRC-related fusion confinement physics. Furthermore, given the mathematical equivalence to Hill's vortex, this updates our topological understanding of fluid flow in a wide array of phenomena.",
