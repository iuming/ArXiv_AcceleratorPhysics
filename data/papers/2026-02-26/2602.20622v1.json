  "title": "A Low Cost Picoseconds Precision Timing and Synchronization Over A Hundred Kilometer",
  "abstract": "Large-scale systems, such as very large accelerators used for fundamental research, require the implementation of precise timing and synchronization systems over distances of several tens of kilometers. A very high precision has been demonstrated by the use of costly and complex clock distribution systems. However, many devices, such as accelerator diagnostics or large-scale detectors, only require picosecond precision. An approach exploiting the CERN White Rabbit protocol, deployed and enhanced on an electronic system capable of generating arbitrary frequencies with Hertz precision, is proposed here. Results of performance tests for the synchronization of a laser system, typically employed as a diagnostic for electron/positron beam polarimetry in accelerators, are provided in this Paper. We demonstrate that without implementing corrections for environmental changes, as temperature drifts, the system can synchronize a pulsed laser with picoseconds precision over a hundred kilometers, exhibiting drifts of a few picoseconds. This work paves the way for a low-cost implementation of picosecond synchronization of accelerator components and large-scale detectors.",
