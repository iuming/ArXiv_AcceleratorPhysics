  "title": "Fast Spectrogram Event Extraction via Offline Self-Supervised Learning: From Fusion Diagnostics to Bioacoustics",
  "abstract": "Next-generation fusion facilities like ITER face a \"data deluge,\" generating petabytes of multi-diagnostic signals daily that challenge manual analysis. We present a \"signals-first\" self-supervised framework for the automated extraction of coherent and transient modes from high-noise time-frequency data. We also develop a general-purpose method and tool for extracting coherent, quasi-coherent, and transient modes for fluctuation measurements in tokamaks by employing non-linear optimal techniques in multichannel signal processing with a fast neural network surrogate on fast magnetics, electron cyclotron emission, CO2 interferometers, and beam emission spectroscopy measurements from DIII-D. Results are tested on data from DIII-D, TJ-II, and non-fusion spectrograms. With an inference latency of 0.5 seconds, this framework enables real-time mode identification and large-scale automated database generation for advanced plasma control.
