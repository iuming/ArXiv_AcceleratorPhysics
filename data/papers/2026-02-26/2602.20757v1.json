  "title": "Entropy stable numerical schemes for divergence diminishing Chew, Goldberger & Low equations for plasma flows",
  "abstract": "Chew, Goldberger & Low (CGL) equations are a set of hyperbolic PDEs with non-conservative products used to model the plasma flows, when the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not valid, and the pressure tensor is assumed to be rotated by the magnetic field. This results in the pressure tensor, which is described by the two scalar components. As the magnetic field also evolves, controlling the divergence of the magnetic field is important. In this work, we consider the generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) technique for the CGL model. The resulting model is referred to as the GLM-CGL system. To make the system suitable for entropy-stable schemes, we reformulate the GLM-CGL system by treating some conservative terms as non-conservative. The resulting system has a non-conservative part that does not affect entropy evolution. We then propose entropy stable numerical methods for the GLM-CGL model. The numerical results for the GLM-CGL system are then compared with the CGL system without the GLM divergence diminishing approach to demonstrate that the GLM approach indeed leads to significant improvement in the magnetic field divergence diminishing.",
