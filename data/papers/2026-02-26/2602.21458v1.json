  "title": "Precision measurements of 2-3 oscillation parameters in the next-generation long-baseline experiments",
  "abstract": "Over the past few decades, data from leading neutrino experiments have firmly established neutrino oscillation, implying non-zero neutrino masses and leptonic mixing and thereby providing confirmed evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. On the backdrop of the precision era of neutrino oscillation, this thesis underscores its relevance by demonstrating the physics reach of the forthcoming long-baseline experiments -- Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) -- to establish non-maximal $θ_{23}$, resolve the correct $θ_{23}$ octant, and improve the precision on $θ_{23}$ and $Δm^2_{31}$ by efficiently breaking parameter degeneracies. This is enabled by DUNE's high-resolution LArTPC detector and its wide-band beam, achieving sensitivity at a high confidence level compared to the global fits of world neutrino data. The combined analysis of DUNE and Hyper-K not only significantly enhances sensitivity to these phenomenological studies but also demonstrates their capabilities at lower exposures when operated together, relative to their nominal individual exposures. In addition, we investigate the impact of flavor-dependent long-range interactions arising from anomaly-free U(1)' extensions of the Standard Model, showing that although subdominant long-range interactions can substantially influence the sensitivity and precision of oscillation parameter measurements, the complementary strengths of DUNE and Hyper-K mitigate these challenges to a large extent.",
