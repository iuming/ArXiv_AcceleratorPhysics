  "title": "Conventional Accelerator Magnets",
  "abstract": "This course introduces conventional magnets used in particle accelerators, focusing on both normal-conducting copper coil magnets and permanent magnets (PMs). It covers magnet classification, design principles, material selection, and mechanical constraints. Advantages and limitations of PMs compared to copper coil magnets are discussed. Key construction steps and cooling methods are presented. The course also includes magnetic field measurement techniques and quality control. Practical examples from PSI and CERN illustrate the concepts.",
