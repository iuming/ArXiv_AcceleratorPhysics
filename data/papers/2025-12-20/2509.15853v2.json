  "title": "Electron-positron pair generation using a single kJ-class laser pulse in a foam-reflector setup",
  "abstract": "We investigate the process of creating electron-positron pairs from laser-matter interaction in pre-ionised foam targets using particle-in-cell simulations. A high-intensity laser pulse drives electrons via direct laser acceleration up to a cone-shaped reflector. The high-energy electrons interact with the reflected laser pulse, generating abundant pairs. The effects of the plasma-channel shape on the propagation of the laser pulse and subsequent pair production is studied. The results show that the number of Compton emission and Breit-Wheeler pair creation events is highly sensitive to the diffraction of the laser due to its interaction with the foam.",
