  "title": "Advanced Shaping of Quasi-Bessel Beams for High-Intensity Applications",
  "abstract": "Quasi-Bessel beams produced by axiparabolas are increasingly used in high-intensity laser applications, yet their longitudinal profiles exhibit unwanted oscillations that limit their effectiveness. Here we identify the physical origin of these distortions and develop a general strategy to control the on-axis intensity of extended focal lines. By combining analytical insight with numerical and experimental validation, we show how both smooth and sharply structured longitudinal profiles can be reliably produced. This establishes a robust framework for tailoring quasi-Bessel beams in regimes relevant to laser-plasma acceleration, advanced photon sources, and other high-field applications.",
