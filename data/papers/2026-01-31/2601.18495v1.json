  "title": "Evidence of Langmuir/$\\mathcal{Z}$-mode Wave Decay into $\\mathcal{Z}$-mode Electromagnetic Radiation in the Solar Wind",
  "abstract": "The nonlinear decay of Langmuir/$\\mathcal{Z}$-mode waves into electromagnetic $\\mathcal{Z}$-mode wave radiation at the plasma frequency is observed for the first time in the solar wind. This finding was enabled by the unprecedented high-resolution electric and magnetic field measurements provided by the Radio Plasma Waves (RPW) instrument aboard the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, which encountered an electron beam associated with a Type III radio burst. The decay process is definitively identified through multiple lines of evidence: satisfaction of frequency and wavevector resonance conditions, strong phase coherence and temporal coincidence between the interacting waves, exclusion of competing mechanisms, and full agreement with theoretical predictions. Particle-in-cell simulations, conducted under close beam-plasma conditions, successfully reproduce the key features of the observations. Notably, they suggest that the wave packet observed by Solar Orbiter may be trapped within an extended, nearly flat-bottomed density well, where the decay process is not overcome by wave scattering on random density fluctuations and subsequent mode conversion effects.",
