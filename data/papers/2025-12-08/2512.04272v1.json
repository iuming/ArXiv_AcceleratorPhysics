  "title": "A simple procedure for generating a Kappa distribution in PIC simulation",
  "abstract": "For kinetic modeling of plasma processes in space, a rejection-sampling procedure for generating a Kappa distribution in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation is proposed. A Pareto distribution is employed as an envelope distribution. The procedure only requires uniform variates, and its acceptance efficiency is $\\approx 0.73$--$0.8$.",
