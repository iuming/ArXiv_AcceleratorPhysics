  "title": "Intrinsic Resolution of Organic Scintillators",
  "abstract": "Fluctuations in photon production within scintillators contribute to the overall energy resolution of scintillation detectors. While typically negligible, this contribution - known as intrinsic resolution (IR) - presents significant challenges for both experimental measurement and Monte Carlo simulation. Using the phenomenological model proposed in~[1], we interpreted multiple datasets of IR measurements in organic scintillators. Although our results generally agree with the IR dataset examined in~[1], a comprehensive evaluation of systematic uncertainties highlights the necessity for more detailed investigation. Based on our findings, we offer specific recommendations for future measurements.",
