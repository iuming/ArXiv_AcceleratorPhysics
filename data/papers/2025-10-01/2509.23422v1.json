  "title": "Cryogenic Materials Repository: A Public Resource and New Measurements   for Cryogenic Research Applications",
  "abstract": "Low-temperature systems play a vital role in a variety of scientific research applications, including the next generation of cosmology and astrophysics telescopes. More ambitious cryogenic applications require precise estimates of the thermal conductivity of materials and thermal joints to meet project goals. We present the development of the Cryogenic Material Repository (CMR), a public GitHub repository of cryogenic material properties data created to support and enable researchers across scientific disciplines to accurately and efficiently design and assess cryogenic systems. We also present updated sub-Kelvin thermal conductivity results for select carbon fiber reinforced polymer and aluminum alloy samples.",
