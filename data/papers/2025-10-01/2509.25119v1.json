  "title": "Single-shot, simultaneous spatially resolved polarimetry and wavefront   sensing with stress engineered optics",
  "abstract": "We present an experimental test of the use of stress engineered optics incorporated into a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor in such a way that the shape of the point spread function (PSF) provides polarization information while the displacement of the PSF gives information about the local wavefront gradient, allowing a reconstruction of the wavefront gradient. Using calibrated polarizations and wavefront tilts we construct a measurement matrix capable of reconstructing both the Stokes parameters and the wavefront, yielding a measurement of wavefront gradients as small as 100 $\\mu$rad with a polarimetric angular error of approximately 0.1 radians on the Poincar\\'e sphere in a single frame measurement.",
