  "title": "Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection",
  "abstract": "The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence of any other non-ideal effect. It will be shown that when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This field is $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}} \\equiv \\vec{B} + \\vec{\\nabla}\\times \\left( (c/\\omega_{pe})^2\\mu_0\\vec{j} \\right)$ with $\\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\\vec{j}$ the current density. In three dimensional space, the practical importance of the ideal evolution of $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}}$ on its reconnection appears limited. When the evolution velocity of modified field is chaotic, $\\vec{\\mathcal{B}}$ will reconnect on a timescale that depends only logarithmically on any non-ideal effect that is diffusive, such as resistivity, with a current density enhancement that is also proportional to the logarithm. In near ideal magnetic fields, this logarithm is typically of order ten, and it is difficult to conceive of a physically realistic situation in which it larger than a hundred.",
