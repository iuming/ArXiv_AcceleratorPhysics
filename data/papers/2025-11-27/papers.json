    "title": "Diffusion for Fusion: Designing Stellarators with Generative AI",
    "abstract": "Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.",

    "title": "Benchmarking the Use of BPM Quadrupole Moments to Measure Emittance",
    "abstract": "For the PIP-II program, transverse emittance in the Fermilab Booster must remain well controlled at higher bunch intensities. 4-plate beam position monitors (BPMs) have a small but measurable quadrupole moment, making it possible to infer transverse emittance. By compositing many BPMs together, it becomes possible to improve the quality of the quadrupole signal. The Fermilab Booster BPM system has been used to measure these quadrupole moments in the past year and derive emittances from them. Recent benchmarks show that the derived BPM emittances show similar emittance evolution and value to IPM and Multiwire data. This approach can both supplement and complement existing non-intercepting emittance monitors in accelerators.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Josephson junctions are key elements in superconducting electronics. The most common type is the overlap (sandwich-type) junction, formed by vertically stacking two superconducting layers. In contrast, planar junctions are fabricated without overlap, at the edge of two superconducting films within a single plane. This geometric distinction has a significant impact on their physical properties. The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes. I will also discuss the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the evolving field of superconducting electronics.",

    "abstract": "In anticipation of the completion of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) programme by the end of 2041, CERN is preparing to launch a new major facility in the mid-2040s. According to the 2020 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), the highest-priority next collider is an electron-positron Higgs factory, followed in the longer term by a hadron-hadron collider at the highest achievable energy. The CERN directorate established a Future Colliders Comparative Evaluation working group in June 2023. This group brings together project leaders and domain experts to conduct a consistent evaluation of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and alternative scenarios based on shared assumptions and standardized criteria. This report presents a comparative evaluation of proposed future collider projects submitted as input for the Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. These proposals are compared considering main performance parameters, environmental impact and sustainability, technical maturity, cost of construction and operation, required human resources, and realistic implementation timelines. An overview of the international collider projects within a similar timeframe, notably the CEPC in China and the ILC in Japan is also presented, as well as a short review of the status and prospects of new accelerator techniques.",

    "title": "Relativistic Jets and Winds in Radio-Identified Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates",
    "abstract": "Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.",

    "abstract": "The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Far Detector (FD) Photon Detection System (PDS) employs the X-Arapuca concept, a photon trapping system relying on reflective surfaces and dichroic filters. In this paper are reported measurements, performed at the University of Milano-Bicocca, aimed at increasing the FD Horizontal Drift (HD) PDS module efficiency. The baseline implementation of the X-Arapuca concept for the FD-HD PDS module is close to the DUNE requirements as demonstrated in the collaborations laboratory testing. However, an increased performance would provide a safety margin for a detector planned to be operated for 30 years, without possibility of performing maintenance. A higher detector performance would also benefit the DUNE low energy physics program. The already proven Milano-Bicocca setup has been utilized to test different PDS module configurations comparing them to the original baseline. Exploiting prior knowledge of the X-Arapuca components and Geant4 based optical simulations it has been possible to achieve up to an ~84% performance increase over the baseline design. In the following it is presented the testing procedure, the performed measurements and a brief discussion on the obtained results.",

    "title": "Graph Neural Network-Based Pipeline for Track Finding in the Velo at LHCb",
    "abstract": "Over the next decade, increases in instantaneous luminosity and detector granularity will amplify the amount of data that has to be analysed by high-energy physics experiments, whether in real time or offline, by an order of magnitude. The reconstruction of charged particle tracks, which has always been a crucial element of offline data processing pipelines, must increasingly be deployed from the very first stages of the real time processing to enable experiments to achieve their physics goals. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received a great deal of attention in the community because their computational complexity scales nearly linearly with the number of hits in the detector, unlike conventional algorithms which often scale quadratically or worse. This paper presents ETX4VELO, a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's Vertex Locator, in the context of LHCb's fully GPU-based first-level trigger system, Allen. Currently implemented in Python, ETX4VELO offers the ability to reconstruct tracks with shared hits using a novel triplet-based method. When benchmarked against the traditional track-finding algorithm in Allen, this GNN-based approach not only matches but occasionally surpasses its physics performance. In particular, the fraction of fake tracks is reduced from over 2% to below 1% and the efficiency to reconstruct electrons is improved. While achieving comparable physics performance is a milestone, the immediate priority remains implementing ETX4VELO in Allen in order to determine and optimise its throughput, to meet the demands of this high-rate environment.",

It is based on the surface scattering kernel, which describes the scattering cascade of the electron in the solid and the excitation of secondary electrons. The resulting boundary condition is inelastic, angle- and energy-dependent. The implementation for a Boltzmann equation solved by a Legendre polynomial expansion method is presented, elucidating the modest additional computational cost of the new boundary condition. Results, indicating the influence of the inelasticity, are shown for the example of a silicon wall facing argon, helium and oxygen plasmas, but the described construction is also valid for other materials. An effective reflection coefficient is defined to compare the results with previously used boundary conditions.",

    "abstract": "In many astrophysical scenarios, alpha induced reactions on noble gas nuclei play a crucial role. Studying these reactions in the laboratory requires the noble gas atoms to be confined in a sufficient amount to allow the reactions. At Atomki thin-windowed gas-cell targets were developed and improved for studying alpha induced reactions on noble gases. Several stages of the gas-cell design used for activation experiments and lately a version to be used for particle scattering experiments will be presented.   A new experimental study of the $^3$He($α$,$γ$)$^7$Be reaction with one of the activation gas-cell targets was performed. This reaction plays an important role both in the solar pp-chains and in big bang nucleosynthesis. The reaction cross section was measured in the past in several works, however, there are still energy regions lacking experimental data, rendering the extrapolations towards the astrophysically relevant energies uncertain. New experimental total cross section of the $^3$He($α$,$γ$)$^7$Be reaction was thus determined here in the energy range of $E_\\mathrm{c.m.} = 2600-3000$ keV in about 50 keV energy steps. These results confirm the overall trend, and also the absolute scale set by the only one previous measurement in this energy range.   In addition, two pilot experiments with the scattering cell were performed aiming to study the $^4$He($α$,$α$)$^4$He and $^{124}$Xe($α$,$α$)$^{124}$Xe reactions at $E_α= 18$ MeV. These studies benchmark the performance of the cell and detection system both for light and heavy noble gas targets.",

    "abstract": "Radio frequency knock out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Excitation signals comprising many betatron sidebands have shown to reduce intensity fluctuations of the extracted beam spill and are used at several facilities. In this contribution, the effect of individual sidebands at different harmonics on the spill quality is systematically studied using efficient noise excitation signals fully covering the respective sidebands. Particle tracking simulations show a clear correlation between the chosen excitation frequency and the spill quality. This relation is attributed to the spectrum of particle motion shortly before their extraction, and an empiric relation between the spectrum, the excitation frequency, and the resulting spill quality is given. Experiments show an additional reduction of pile-up when using higher excitation frequencies. These insights have implications for an optimal design of excitation waveforms and hardware for Knock Out extraction systems.",

Analysis of the underlying microphysics reveals that a shear-flow ion-Weibel instability generates magnetic fields, which isotropize the incoming flow and mediate shock formation. An analytical expression for the shear-flow magnetic field is derived, and a scaling law relating the magnetic field amplitude to the laser intensity is established. This mechanism reduces the shock formation time and the required laser energy by three and two orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to high-power laser experiments, making it feasible to produce IW-CSs using existing multi-kilojoule, picosecond ultraintense laser facilities.",

    "title": "Investigation of Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating Driven by Broadband Lasers",
    "abstract": "Broadband lasers have become a key strategy for mitigating laser plasma instabilities in inertial confinement fusion, yet their impact on collisional inverse bremsstrahlung (IB) heating remains unclear. Using one-dimensional collisional particle-in-cell simulations, we systematically examine the effect of bandwidth-induced temporal incoherence on IB absorption in Au plasmas. The simulations are first benchmarked against classical absorption theory, verifying that the implemented Coulomb collision model accurately reproduces the theoretical IB heating rate. A direct comparison of the electron temperature evolution in the broadband and monochromatic cases shows that, although spectral broadening introduces transient picosecond-scale oscillations in the heating rate driven by stochastic intensity fluctuations, the long-term averaged heating and net IB absorption remain essentially unchanged.",

    "abstract": "The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration is designing a new generation of low background, noble liquid bubble chamber experiments with sub-keV nuclear recoil threshold. These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture.",

    "abstract": "We present an investigation into beam steering and radiation emission by sub-GeV electrons traversing bent silicon crystals. Using 855, 600, and 300~MeV electron beams at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI), we explored orientational coherent effects and particle dynamics in a 15~$μ$m-thick crystal bent along the (111) planes. Combined experimental and simulation analyses enabled the classification and quantitative assessment of the contributions from channeling, dechanneling, rechanneling, and volume capture to both beam deflection and radiation emission. Crystal steering remained effective even at 300~MeV, with measured channeling efficiencies exceeding 50\\%, a record at such low energy. Channeling and volume reflection enhanced radiation emission by up to a factor of six compared to the misaligned orientation, highlighting strong orientational coherence effects in the sub-GeV regime. These findings confirm the feasibility of using bent crystals for efficient beam manipulation and high-intensity photon generation at low energies, supporting the development of novel light sources and beam control strategies at accelerator facilities operating in this energy range.",

    "title": "Direct Optimization of Fast-Ion Confinement in Stellarators",
    "abstract": "Confining energetic ions such as alpha particles is a prime concern in the design of stellarators. However, directly measuring alpha confinement through numerical simulation of guiding-center trajectories has been considered to be too computationally expensive and noisy to include in the design loop, and instead has been most often used only as a tool to assess stellarator designs post hoc. In its place, proxy metrics, simplified measures of confinement, have often been used to design configurations because they are computationally more tractable and have been shown to be effective. Despite the success of proxies, it is unclear what is being sacrificed by using them to design the device rather than relying on direct trajectory calculations. In this study, we optimize stellarator designs for improved alpha particle confinement without the use of proxy metrics. In particular, we numerically optimize an objective function that measures alpha particle losses by simulating alpha particle trajectories. While this method is computationally expensive, we find that it can be used successfully to generate configurations with low losses.",

    "abstract": "The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) project is a vital upgrade to the Fermilab accelerator complex. The magnet pulse rate of the PIP-II Injection system requires an increase from the current rate of 15 Hz to 20 Hz as well as a roughly 30% increase in the magnetic field of the new Orbital Bump (ORBUMP) pulsed dipole magnets in the Booster. The ORBUMP magnet mechanical design is presented in this paper. The ORBUMP magnet is secured in a vacuum box and the core is made up of 0.127 mm thick, low carbon steel laminations with a C-5 inorganic magnesium phosphate coating. The core is clamped using external tie bars welded to the core end plates. ANSYS Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate the clamping design to minimize the deflection of the core post welding of the tie bars. The water-cooled, single turn coil, which shapes the magnetic field by acting as the pole tips, is critical for the integrated field homogeneity. The coil manufacturing tolerances and fabrication techniques were evaluated to ensure the magnetic properties of the magnet could be obtained. The coil is electrically isolated from the core using virgin Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) insulating material in the gap. An investigation into the high voltage performance of the virgin PEEK insulator was conducted via partial discharge testing using a 1:1 scale sample.",

A theoretical framework has been formulated to unify various methods for efficiently solving the electron drift kinetic equation in multiscale simulations by separating electron responses into analytic and non-analytic parts based on the smallness parameter of electron-to-ion mass ratio. The model can be reduced to the ideal MHD model with both the linear dispersion relation and the nonlinear ponderomotive force in theory and simulation. The model is used for the verification and validation of simulating internal kink modes in the DIII-D tokamak with accurate calculations of equilibrium parallel current and compressible magnetic perturbation. A large simulation database has been generated to train a surrogate model to predict the kink instability. Statistical analysis shows that the radial location of safety factor q=1 flux-surface and the plasma beta inside the q=1 surface are the most important parameters for predicting the kink instability.",

    "title": "Anisotropic Cosmic Ray Transport in strong MHD Turbulence due to Magnetic Mirroring and Resonant Curvature Scattering",
    "abstract": "The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test-particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with $δB/B_0\\sim 1$ and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch-angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch-angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a Lévy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch-angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories that fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic-ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.",

    "title": "Two-Stream Instability and Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Mode Formation in Coulomb One Component Plasma",
    "abstract": "We investigate the Two-Stream Instability in a strongly coupled plasma using classical molecular dynamics simulations with long-range Coulomb interactions between particles. The nonlinear evolution of the instability is identified by the emergence of a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) mode. Our simulations capture key microscopic effects, such as inter-particle correlations, collisional dynamics, and coherent wave-particle interactions-features often absent in traditional fluid and kinetic models, including Particle-In-Cell and Vlasov approaches. In the linear regime, the instability grows rapidly and saturates within a few tens of plasma periods. As the system transitions into the nonlinear saturation phase, a single BGK mode emerges. This mode (or phase-space hole) becomes dynamically unstable in the nonlinear regime, characterized by a continuous decay of electrostatic energy over time. An energy budget analysis reveals a bump in an otherwise thermal spectrum, indicating the excitation of a coherent mode, further confirmed through a numerical rendering of the dispersion relation. The pairwise interaction plays a crucial role: pronounced instability and BGK mode formation occur with long-range Coulomb forces, while such structures are suppressed under shielded Coulomb interactions. We observe the emergence of a single BGK mode across all coupling strengths in the fluid regime, provided the streaming velocity exceeds a critical threshold.",

    "abstract": "The Muon to Electron Experiment (Mu2e) requires a uniform beam profile from the Muon Delivery Ring to meet their experimental needs. A specialized Spill Regulation System (SRS) has been developed to help achieve consistent spill uniformity. The system is based on a custom-designed carrier board featuring an Arria 10 SoC, capable of executing real-time feedback control. The FPGA processes beam pulses of approximately 200 ns every 1.695 $μ$s, allowing for continuous monitoring of the extracted spill intensity through fast bunch integration. The system directly controls three quadrupole magnets, which work in conjunction with sextupole magnets to achieve third-order resonant extraction. Furthermore, the board interfaces with Fermilab's Accelerator Control Network (ACNET), enabling operators to modify spill regulation settings in real-time via the control network while providing diagnostic waveforms. These waveforms help operators monitor the process and fine-tune the feedback mechanisms. This paper presents an overview of the board's architecture and its initial progress toward regulating beam extraction. This initial version of the regulation system aims to evaluate baseline performance to inform future system improvements.",

    "title": "Insights into neutron transport in a new multipurpose nuclear reactor",
    "abstract": "Neutron transport inside the reflector tank of the new Brazilian nuclear reactor, called the RMB (Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor), is investigated using the stochastic Monte Carlo method. One of the main characteristics of research nuclear reactors is the core power density, which is proportional to the neutron flux generated in the fission reaction. The RMB is part of the new generation of multipurpose reactors, and studying neutron transport is essential for the project to meet its objectives of producing radioisotopes, irradiating materials, and generating neutron beams for scientific investigations. The neutron moderation process in the reflector tank is very well described by Maxwellian distributions, which provide temperatures ranging from T = 331.5 K in the core to T = 266.8 K in the peripheral regions. The relative proportions reveal the predominance (52%) of epithermal neutrons in the reactor core, followed by thermal (29%) and fast (19%) neutrons. The moderation process proves to be effective, considering that 100% of the neutrons fall within the thermal spectrum near the reflector tank wall. The fits using Maxwellian distributions reveal another effect of neutron moderation, a shift in the peak wavelength from 1.07 Å to 1.19 Å. The same effect is observed along the tube that supplies a neutron beam to the RMB imaging instrument, with $λ_{peak}$ = 1.18 Å increasing to $λ_{peak}$ = 1.21 Å.",

    "title": "Topmetal-L: A Low Noise Charge-Sensitive Pixel Sensor for POLAR2/LPD",
    "abstract": "POLAR-2 is a next-generation space astronomy platform led by China, with its core scientific objective focused on high-precision polarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts. As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2$\\sim$10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $μ$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\\times$ 26 $μ$m$^2$ charge-collecting window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0$\\sim$4 ke$^{-}$, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $μ$V/e$^{-}$, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e$^{-}$, a sensitive area exceeding 3.69 cm$^2$, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $μ$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.05 keV source, and a count rate saturated at 15 k counts$\\cdot$cm$^{-2}$$\\cdot$s$^{-1}$ when tested at 5.40 keV.",

    "title": "Approximate resolution convolution function for fitting a dispersion gap measured on a triple-axis spectrometer",
    "abstract": "We present an analytic convoluted-gap function, eq. 11 in the manuscript, for fitting dispersion gaps measured on triple-axis spectrometers (TAS). At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting. Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data.",

    "title": "Abnormal Polarity Effect on the DC Breakdown Voltage in Short SF6 Gap",
    "abstract": "In this Letter, through the comparison between experiment and numerical simulation, we reveal the dynamic mechanism underlying the abnormal polarity effect in SF6 short-gap DC breakdown, as well as a novel criterion for predicting negative breakdown voltage. Using the traditional single-streamer breakdown criterion, the simulated positive breakdown voltage agrees well with experimental measurements, whereas the simulated negative breakdown voltage deviates markedly from the experiments, so the single-streamer breakdown criterion fails to reproduce the abnormal polarity effect observed experimentally. In addressing this, we propose an ion-ion plasma breakdown criterion for negative breakdown voltage. When this novel criterion is applied, the simulated negative breakdown voltage agrees with the experiments and reflects the abnormal polarity effect. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of key physical parameters reveals that, the dynamic mechanism for ion-ion plasma breakdown for negative polarity can be divided into four stages: primary streamer stage, ion accumulation stage, reconstructive ionization stage, and ion-ion plasma propagation stage. Notably, the ion-ion plasma propagation stage is dominated by photoionization-driven negative-ion accumulation rather than conventional impact ionization.",

    "title": "Physics-informed Neural Operator Learning for Nonlinear Grad-Shafranov Equation",
    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.",

    "title": "Bell Plesset Effects on Rayleigh Taylor Instability of Three Dimensional Spherical Geometry",
    "abstract": "We develop a weakly nonlinear, multi-mode theory for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) on a time-varying spherical interface, fully incorporating mode couplings and the Bell-Plesset (BP) effects arising from interface convergence. Our model extends prior analyses, which have been largely restricted to static backgrounds, 2D cylindrical geometries, or single-mode initial conditions. We present a framework capable of evolving arbitrary, fully three-dimensional initial perturbations on a dynamic background. At the first order, mode amplitudes respond to the time-varying interface acceleration with an exponential-like growth, in qualitative agreement with classic static results. At second order, nonlinear mode coupling reveals a powerful selection rule: energy is preferentially channeled into axisymmetric (m=0) modes. We find that the BP effects dramatically amplify the instability growth by a few orders of magnitude, with this amplification being even more significant for second order couplings. Despite this strong channeling, the second order amplitudes remain small relative to the first order, validating the perturbative approach. These findings offer new physical insights into time-dependent interface instabilities relevant to applications such as astrophysical shell collapse and inertial confinement fusion, highlighting the uniquely dominant role of axisymmetric modes in BP-driven convergent flows.",

    "abstract": "In collisionless plasmas, relaxation of the deviations of ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) occurs through particle interactions with electromagnetic fields. In particular, in the Earth's magnetotail, the deviations of the ion VDFs, typically consisting of multiple components, from the equilibrium must be limited to maintain stability of the current sheet. Curvature scattering is a leading candidate mechanism to limit such deviations, but its role remains insufficiently understood. We investigate the limits of ion temperature anisotropy in a magnetotail-like configuration by modeling a quasi-1D current sheet with a finite magnetic field curvature and three ion populations. We derive analytical thresholds for anisotropy based on current sheet stability and validate against spacecraft observations and numerical results. Our findings demonstrate that curvature scattering imposes limits on ion anisotropies, thereby maintaining the stability of the current sheet.",

Active beam steering loops, utilizing differential wavefront sensing (DWS) signals, ensure co-alignment between the receiving (RX) beam and the transmitting (TX) beam. With spacecraft attitude jitter simulated by hexapod-driven rotations, the interferometric link achieves a pointing stability below 10 urad/$\\mathrm{\\sqrt{Hz}}$ in the frequency range between 2 mHz and 0.5 Hz, and the fluctuation of the TX beam's polarization state results in a reduction of 0.14\\% in the carrier-to-noise-density ratio over a 15-hour continuous measurement. Additionally, tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling is experimentally investigated using the periodic scanning of the hexapod. Experimental results show that the on-axis LRI enables the inter-spacecraft ranging measurements with nanometer accuracy, making it a potential candidate for future GRACE-like missions.",

Strong $N^2$ dependence of radiation intensity on slab number is re-established in special case of the disordered stack. This leads to strong directivity either on forward or on backward Brewster angles depending on the type of stack randomness. In certain type of periodic photonic crystal, a strong energy dependence $E^4$ for relativistic particles of the radiation intensity, observed at Brewster's angle is found. Further increment of particle energy leads to saturation. The band structure of the corresponding photonic crystal (PhC) has a behavior, analogous to the Dirac cones in graphene.

    "title": "Development of a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber prototype for the RELICS experiment",
    "abstract": "The RELICS (REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering) experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from reactor antineutrinos using a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. To validate the detector concept and ensure technical reliability for the full-scale experiment, a dedicated prototype was designed, constructed, and operated. This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational wave detection has transformed astrophysics, granting us direct access to black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and the cataclysms of stellar death. Yet the great observatories of today, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the planned Einstein Telescope, rest on Michelson interferometers that, despite their triumphs, confront fundamental barriers of scale, cost, and environmental vulnerability. We envision a new path, a Sagnac-based fiber interferometer that leverages reciprocity and inherent robustness. Its meter-scale, modular design compact enough to fit within a small facility, offers dramatic gains in scalability and affordability over kilometer scale Michelson systems. Tunable to frequency bands where conventional detectors lose sensitivity, it opens the door to compact, versatile, and accessible GW observatories, empowering universities and research centers worldwide. Linked together in a global network, such facilities could transcend mere detection, they could localize cosmic sources and reconstruct them into images, much as black holes were first directly revealed, ushering in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and multi-messenger discovery.",

    "title": "Radiation tolerance test and damage of single-crystal CVD Diamond sensor under high fluence particles",
    "abstract": "Single-crystal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond is a promising material for radiation detectors operating in extreme environments, owing to its outstanding radiation hardness. As nuclear and high-energy physics applications demand particle detectors that withstand higher radiation fluences, understanding the damage thresholds and degradation mechanisms of diamond-based detectors is essential. In this study, single-crystal CVD diamond sensors were exposed to fast neutron irradiation at fluences up to $3.3\\times10^{17}$ ${n/cm^2}$. Modules exhibited stable output confirming potential for application in future high-dose radiation environments. The dominant defects were identified as point defects including <100> self interstitials, vacancies, and lattice disorder. Macroscopic defects including nanocavities and cracks were observed with areal densities approaching $10^7$ $cm^{-2}$. The impact of 100 MeV proton irradiation on diamond detector response was quantified by extracting a damage constant of $k^{100 MeV}_{proton}=(1.452\\pm0.006)\\times10^{-18}cm^2/(p\\cdotμm)$ from a linear carrier drift degradation model. The mean free path of carriers was found to exhibit saturation behavior beyond a fluence of $4\\times10^{16}$ ${p/cm^2}$ under 100 MeV proton irradiation. Monte Carlo together with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to assess irradiation induced defect and its influence on carrier transport. By considering saturation effects and defect-interaction corrections, we develop an enhanced carrier-drift degradation model that accurately captures detector response under high-dose irradiation. Furthermore, the simulation framework was applied to evaluate damage induced by protons and pions on diamond at various energies, yielding results that show better agreement with experimental data than conventional NIEL based estimates.",

    "title": "Multiplexed SiPM Readout of Plastic Scintillating Fiber Detector for Muon Tomography",
    "abstract": "Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray muons to probe dense materials. A plastic Scintillating Fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact and high-resolution solution. However, constructing a large-area SciFi detector demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, we present a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm, enabling up to $N_{\\textrm{SiPM}}^{\\textrm{max}}=C^{2}_{N_{\\textrm{ele}}}$ SiPM channels to be read out using only ${N_{\\textrm{ele}}}$ electronic channels. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the choice of appropriate diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. A multiplexed SciFi detector module comprising 21 SiPM channels read out through 7 electronic channels are constructed. Electronic tests show that this module exhibits low crosstalk between electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range from $\\sim$10 to 122 photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further show that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to the direct (per SiPM channel) readout. These results verify that the proposed method provides a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.",

    "title": "Transition to Petschek Reconnection in Subrelativistic Pair Plasmas: Implications for Particle Acceleration",
    "abstract": "While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($σ\\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($σ< 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$σ$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$σ$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$σ$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.",

    "abstract": "Recently, using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, it has been demonstrated that in laser based proton acceleration with micro-structured targets, a single rectangular groove on the target front offers significant proton cut-off enhancement with linearly polarised laser pulses. In the present work, three-dimensional investigations are carried out to identify notable differences between cylindrical and cuboidal groove geometries both of which correspond to a rectangular groove in a two-dimensional case. In particular, a waveguide model is employed to analyse the effect of the groove geometry and extensive three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed to demonstrate the distinct behaviour of laser pulse and electrons for cylindrical and cuboidal grooves. Further, the effect of a circular polarisation of the incident laser pulse on the spectra of accelerated protons is studied. It is shown that contrary to our initial expectations, cylindrical symmetry and circular polarisation do not play well together and cause as much as 15$\\%$ decay in proton cut-off energies as compared to the case of cylindrical symmetry and linear polarisation.",

    "title": "Space-Charge Effects During Half-Integer Resonance Crossing in the CERN PSB",
    "abstract": "The survival of charged particles in synchrotrons requires avoiding setting the beam on machine resonances, the most dangerous of which are the integer and half-integer. Nevertheless, operationally, the transverse tunes may change dynamically, crossing these resonances, and resulting in unwanted beam quality degradation and beam loss. For high intensity beams the process of resonance crossing is even more critical as space charge, in addition to the incoherent effects, may generate also coherent effects on the beam envelope dynamics. The interplay of the speed of resonance crossing, the space charge incoherent tune spread, and half-integer resonance width are fundamental for the beam behavior. In this paper we study the crossing of the half-integer resonance $2Q_y=9$ in the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster~(PSB) for a range of parameters using a coasting beam. We take advantage of the newly commissioned PSB to investigate the beam response experimentally. The experimental findings are also discussed with the support of simulations.",

    "title": "Characterization of the first full-size production for ePIC TOF layers",
    "abstract": "Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are characterized by a fast rise time (500 ps) and extremely good time resolution (down to 17 ps). The intrinsic low granularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for precise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs factories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. AC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating oxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill factor and charge-sharing capabilities. Charge sharing between electrodes allows a hit position resolution well below the pitch/$\\sqrt12$ of standard segmented detectors. At the same time, it relaxes the channel density and power consumption requirements of readout chips. Extensive laboratory characterization of AC-LGAD devices from the first full-size (up to 3x4 cm) production from HPK for ePIC will be shown in this contribution. Both pixel and strip geometry was produced and tested. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R&D program at the EIC.",

    "title": "Efficient Dynamic and Momentum Aperture Optimization for Lattice Design Using Multipoint Bayesian Algorithm Execution",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate that multipoint Bayesian algorithm execution can overcome fundamental computational challenges in storage ring design optimization. Dynamic (DA) and momentum (MA) optimization is a multipoint, multiobjective design task for storage rings, ultimately informing the flux of x-ray sources and luminosity of colliders. Current state-of-art black-box optimization methods require extensive particle-tracking simulations for each trial configuration; the high computational cost restricts the extent of the search to $\\sim 10^3$ configurations, and therefore limits the quality of the final design. We remove this bottleneck using multipointBAX, which selects, simulates, and models each trial configuration at the single particle level. We demonstrate our approach on a novel design for a fourth-generation light source, with neural-network powered multipointBAX achieving equivalent Pareto front results using more than two orders of magnitude fewer tracking computations compared to genetic algorithms. The significant reduction in cost positions multipointBAX as a promising alternative to black-box optimization, and we anticipate multipointBAX will be instrumental in the design of future light sources, colliders, and large-scale scientific facilities.",
