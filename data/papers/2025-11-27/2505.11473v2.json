  "title": "Application of the Portable Diagnostic Package to the Wisconsin High-temperature-superconducting Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM)",
  "abstract": "We present an application of the Portable Diagnostic Package (PDP) on the Wisconsin HTS Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM), which integrates an optical emission spectroscopy (OES) system and an active Thomson scattering (TS) system. Due to the designed portability of our system, we realized the installation of the PDP OES and TS measurements on WHAM in $\\sim$6 months. The OES system facilitates a comprehensive impurity line survey and enables flow measurements through the Doppler effect observed on impurity lines. Notably, plasma rotation profiles were successfully derived from doubly charged carbon lines. In addition, the TS system enabled the first measurements of the electron temperature in commissioning plasmas on WHAM. These successes underscore the diagnostic package's potential for advancing experimental plasma studies.",
