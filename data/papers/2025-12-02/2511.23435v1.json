  "title": "Interrogation trajectory optimisation for Fabry-Perot based photoacoustic tomography",
  "abstract": "Fabry-Pérot based photoacoustic tomography (FP-PAT) is a promising all-optical imaging modality for a wide range of preclinical and clinical applications. However, there exist several challenges in routinely applying FP-PAT in time-critical experiments. Among those, the need for spectral tuning of the laser between each scan position can severely limit the effective imaging speed. Here, we present an interrogation trajectory optimization approach which allows to increase the overall speed in a way that is independent of the type of interrogation laser used as well as the FP quality. Our approach provides a way to tackle speed degradation caused by hardware limitations and simplify the use of FP-PAT systems.",
