  "title": "Experimental study of argon gas breakdown with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations",
  "abstract": "Paschen law relates the breakdown voltage of a gas to the product of gas pressure and inter-electrode distance, predicting a characteristic minimum voltage at a specific pd value. In this study, the role of electrode configurations (symmetric and asymmetric) and inter-electrode spacing on the gas breakdown processes (or Paschen Law) is examined. Numerous sets of experiments are performed with both symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations of different sizes to obtain Paschen curves at different inter-electrode distances. The experimentally obtained Paschen's curves for different electrode configurations are fitted using a proposed modified empirical relation for breakdown voltage, incorporating variable power-law dependencies and fitting parameters to better capture the observed deviations. Upon closer inspection, we observed that the breakdown voltage and the corresponding pd value are influenced by both electrode configurations and the inter-electrode discharge gap. The variation in breakdown voltage and pd minima for different electrode configurations is explained by analyzing the electric field distributions between the electrodes (cathode and anode) for an applied voltage.",
