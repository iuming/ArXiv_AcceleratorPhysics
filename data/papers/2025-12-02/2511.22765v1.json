  "title": "Initial Assessment of Second Generation of Large-Area Picosecond Photodetectors with Multi-Channel Systems-on-a-Chip Readout",
  "abstract": "We first briefly describe the history and motivation behind Cherenkov and scintillation light detection. We then discuss the instrumentation needed to detect these photons as it applies to both photodetectors and readout electronics. One of the motivations is future large neutrino detectors that could in principle differentiate between Cherenkov and scintillation light if using novel water-based scintillators. In this paper, we present the first measurements utilizing the second generation of Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs) in conjunction with commercial system-on-a-chip readouts from Nalu Scientific -- specifically, the High Density System on Chip (HDSoC) and Advanced ASoC Rapid Digitizer, Variable Adaptive Readout Chip (AARDVARC) platforms. These state-of-the-art full-waveform digitizers feature sampling rates on the order of 1 and 10 samples per nanosecond, respectively. Using a picosecond laser, we measured the timing jitter between a pair of LAPPD channels, demonstrating the potential of this setup for precise timing applications.",
