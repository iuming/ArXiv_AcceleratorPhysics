  "title": "A Bidirectional Diode-Clamp Circuit Paradigm for Time-Resolved Measurement of Electrical Short-Circuits",
  "abstract": "Conventional electrical fault models, which rely on static thresholds and instantaneous trip mechanisms, fail to capture the time-evolving dynamics of real faults, creating vulnerabilities in modern power systems. This paper introduces a diode-clamp circuit architecture that reconceives short-circuits as governed, sustained processes and establishes a physics-consistent, measurement system. An Arduino-based data acquisition system recorded continuous fault evolution across multiple input voltages and durations. Multi-resolution sampling at 10ms, 50ms, and 100ms enabled high-fidelity capture of both transients and sustained-state dynamics. The clamped mechanism constrained the circuit to a bounded regime, enabling repeatable observation. Experiments yielded definitive, measurable minima and maxima for voltage, current, and resistance, empirically refuting the classical assumption of instantaneous, unbounded current. Newly introduced metrics quantify this performance: the Sustained-to-Capacitive Energy Ratio (SCER ~1.53x10^12) proves fault energy originates from sustained dynamics, not transient discharge. The Sustained Fault Efficiency (SFE>1) demonstrates that governed fault power can exceed nominal operating power. This work provides the first fully validated short-circuit quantification system, yielding empirical data for next-generation battery management, adaptive grid protection, and fault-tolerant electronics.",
