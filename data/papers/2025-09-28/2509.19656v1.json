  "title": "Anisotropic momentum distributions due to radiation recoil in   relativistic plasmas with electric and magnetic fields",
  "abstract": "The interaction of strong electromagnetic fields with plasma generates radiation accompanied by a recoil force, which can significantly alter the plasma dynamics. In this work, we investigate the development of anisotropic momentum distributions induced by the combined action of electric and magnetic fields on a thermally relativistic plasma. We consider three distinct types of anisotropy. The first arises from a pure magnetic field acting on plasma with either isotropic or anisotropic initial momentum distributions, producing the characteristic ring-shaped momentum profile. The second is driven by a pure electric field, where radiation reaction generates a partial, anisotropic ring distribution in momentum space: significant modifications occur primarily in the 90$^\\circ$--180$^\\circ$ and 270$^\\circ$--360$^\\circ$ sectors of the $p_x$--$p_y$ plane, while the remaining quadrants remain largely unaffected. The third case considers the combined effect of electric and magnetic fields. When the cyclotron frequency is very close to the upper hybrid frequency, the azimuthal symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution is broken. Conversely, in the regime where the cyclotron frequency is lower than the upper hybrid frequency, the rapid oscillations of the electric field dominate and preserve the symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution.",
