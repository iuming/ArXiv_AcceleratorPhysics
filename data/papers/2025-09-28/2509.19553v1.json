  "title": "Generalized mixed variable-pullback scheme with non-ideal Ohm's law for   electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations",
  "abstract": "In this work, the non-ideal Ohm's law is integrated in the mixed variable-pullback scheme for the gyrokinetic particle simulations. This scheme captures the evolution of the symplectic solution of the gyrokinetic model accurately not only in the MHD limit but also in the electrostatic limit. This scheme also provides a pure symplectic ($v_\\shortparallel $) scheme for electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle simulations without causing the traditional cancellation problem in the pure Hamiltonian scheme. Various mixed variable schemes have been comprehensively analyzed for the 1D shear Alfv\\`en wave problem with kinetic electrons, with the connection to the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme and the symplectic scheme. It is demonstrated that the pure $v_\\shortparallel $ form with the non-ideal Ohm's law has comparable performance to the widely used mixed variable-pullback scheme with the ideal Ohm's law. The mixed variable-pullback scheme without Ohm's law is also proposed as a feasible improvement of the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme with minimum modification and considerable performance improvement in terms of a marker number reduction.",
