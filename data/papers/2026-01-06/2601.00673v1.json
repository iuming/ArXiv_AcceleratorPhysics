  "title": "Update on the design of the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment",
  "abstract": "We present the final configuration chosen to be build for the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX), a new stellartor experiment at Columbia University. In a recent publication, Baillod et al. (NF, 2025) discussed in detail the different objectives, constraints, and optimization algorithms used to find an optimal configuration for CSX. In this paper, we build upon this first publication and find a configuration that satisfies all the constraints. We describe this final configuration including discussion of the coil finite build effects, sensitivity analyses, and the plasma neoclassical physics properties using the SFINCS code. These post-processing calculations provide a confirmation that the experimental goals of CSX can be achieved with the presented configuration.",
