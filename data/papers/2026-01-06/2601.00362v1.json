  "title": "On the Theory of Absorption of Sound Waves via the Bulk Viscosity in the Partially Ionized Solar Chromosphere",
  "abstract": "Bulk viscosity and thermodynamic variables of a hydrogen-helium cocktail: internal energy, enthalpy, pressure, their derivatives, heat capacities per constant density and pressure are obtained using temperature and density height profiles of the solar atmosphere [Avrett & Loeser, ApJS Vol. 175, 229 (2008)]. The qualitative evaluation for the necessary sound wave energy flux to heat the solar chromosphere is determined to be 320 kW/m$^2$. It is concluded that the bulk viscosity creates the dominating mechanism of acoustic waves damping and it is not necessary to introduce artificial viscosity or to conclude that shear viscosity is not sufficient for chromosphere heating; the volume viscosity induced wave absorption is sufficient.",
