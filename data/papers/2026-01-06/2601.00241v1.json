  "title": "Revisiting p-$^{11}$B Fusion: Updated Cross-sections, Reactivity, and Energy Balance",
  "abstract": "Recent experimental progress has substantially improved the available cross-section data for the p-$^{11}$B fusion reaction, particularly in energy regions that previously lacked direct measurements. In this study, we develop a high-precision analytical parameterization of the p-$^{11}$B reaction cross-section over the 0--10 MeV energy range, incorporating the new experimental data into a continuous and numerically efficient representation. Using this parameterization, we evaluate the thermonuclear reactivity of the p-$^{11}$B reaction and examine the effects of the dominant resonance at 0.6 MeV and a newly observed resonance around 4.7 MeV. Furthermore, we assess the energy balance by analyzing the fusion power density and the electron bremsstrahlung power density. Our results indicate that p-$^{11}$B fusion is not precluded by bremsstrahlung constraints when contemporary cross-section data and self-consistent thermal modeling are employed.",
