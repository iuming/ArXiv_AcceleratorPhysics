    "title": "Production of High-Specific-Activity Radioisotopes Using High-Energy   Fusion Neutrons",
    "abstract": "We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion can produce many medically important radioisotopes-including $^{99}$Mo/${}^{99\\mathrm{m}}\\mathrm{Tc}$, $^{131}$I, $^{177}$Lu, $^{153}$Sm, $^{111}$In, $^{133}$Xe, $^{32}$P, $^{64}$Cu, $^{60}$Co, $^{103}$Pd, $^{89}$Sr, $^{188}$Re, $^{117}$In/$^{117\\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{90}$Y, and $^{166}$Ho - and emerging isotopes such as $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\\mathrm{m}}$Pt, $^{47}$Sc, ${}^{103}\\mathrm{Ru}/{}^{103\\mathrm{m}}\\mathrm{Rh}$, ${}^{103}\\mathrm{Pd}/{}^{103\\mathrm{m}}\\mathrm{Rh}$, and $^{119}$Sb with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical rather than isotopic separation. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.",

    "abstract": "The cosmic ray veto detector for the Mu2e experiment consists of scintillation bars embedded with wavelength-shifting fibers and read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this manuscript the calibration procedures of the SiPMs are described including corrections for the temperature dependence of their light yield. These corrections are needed as the SiPMs are not kept at a constant temperature due to the complexity and cost of implementing a cooling system on such a large detector. Rather, it was decided to monitor the temperature to allow the appropriate corrections to be made. The SiPM temperature dependence has been measured in a dedicated experiment and the calibration procedures were validated with data from production detectors awaiting installation at Fermilab.",

    "title": "Adjustable Low-Cost Highly Sensitive Microwave Oscillator Sensor for   Liquid Level Detection",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the implementation of a low-cost high-precision microwave oscillator sensor with an adjustable input resistance to enhance its limit of detection (LoD). To achieve this, we introduce a \\textit{Z$_{2}$} branch in the input network, comprising a transmission line, a capacitor (\\textit{C$_{B}$}) and a resistor (\\textit{R$_{V}$}). The sensor is tested with eight different liquids with different dielectric constants, including water, IV fluid, milk, ethanol, acetone, petrol, olive oil, and Vaseline. By fine-tuning the \\textit{Z$_{2}$} branch, a clear relationship is found between $\\varepsilon_{r}$ of materials and R$_{V}$.Our experimental results demonstrate outstanding characteristics, including remarkable linearity (nonlinearity < 2.44\\%), high accuracy with an average sensitivity of 21 kHz/$\\mu$m, and an excellent limit of detection (LoD < 0.05 mm). The sensor also exhibits good stability across a range of liquid temperatures and shows robust and repeatable behavior. Considering the strong absorption of microwave energy in liquids with high dielectric constants, this oscillator sensor is a superior choice over capacitive sensors for such applications. We validate the performance of the oscillator sensor using water as a representative liquid. Additionally, we substantiate the sensor's improvement through both experimental results and theoretical analysis. Its advantages, including affordability, compatibility with CMOS and MEMS technologies, and ease of fabrication, make it an excellent choice for small-scale liquid detection applications.",

    "title": "Time-based Selection of Kaonic Atom X-ray Events with   Quasi-Hemispherical CZT Detectors at the DAFNE collider",
    "abstract": "This work presents the results of a time-based event selection for searching X-ray signals from kaonic atom X-ray transition using a single quasi-hemispherical Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) detector at the DA$\\Phi$NE collider. To mitigate the high background level in the measured X-ray spectrum, a dedicated event selection strategy was developed, exploiting the precise timing correlation between e+e- collisions and detector signals. This approach enabled, for the first time, the observation of two characteristic X-ray transitions from kaonic aluminum atoms using a CZT detector: for the 5-4 transition at 50~keV, 362~$\\pm$~41~(stat.)~$\\pm$~20~(sys.) signal events over 1698~$\\pm$~197~(stat.)~$\\pm$~25~(sys.) background events in 5$\\sigma$ were observed, with a resolution of 9.2\\%~FWHM; for the 4-3 transition at 106~keV, 295~$\\pm$~50~(stat.)~$\\pm$~20~(sys.) signal events over 2939~$\\pm$~500~(stat.)~$\\pm$~16~(sys.) background events in 5$\\sigma$ were measured, with a resolution of 6.6 ~FWHM. A strong background suppression of approximately 95\\% of the triggered data was achieved through this time-based selection. The demonstrated timing capability of the CZT detector proved highly effective in isolating time-correlated events within an 80 ns window, setting an important benchmark for the application of these semiconductors in timing-based X-ray spectroscopy. These results highlight the potential of CZT-based detection systems for future precision measurements in high-radiation environments, paving the way for compact, room-temperature X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray spectrometers in fundamental physics and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The determination of experimental sensitivity is a key step in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$), providing a quantitative benchmark for detector design. Two commonly used statistical approaches are the counting method, which estimates sensitivity from the number of events in a predefined region of interest, and the fitting method, which extracts the signal contribution by fitting the full energy spectrum. In this work, we investigate both discovery sensitivity and exclusion sensitivity within these two approaches. Through statistical derivation and simulation verification, we show that the relative performance of the methods depends on both energy resolution and exposure, while at higher exposures the fitting method consistently yields more stringent sensitivity. These results provide guidance for selecting the optimal statistical method in future $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiments.",

    "title": "LEP3: A High-Luminosity e+e- Higgs and ElectroweakFactory in the LHC   Tunnel",
    "abstract": "As stated in the 2019 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), it is of the utmost importance that the HL-LHC upgrade of the accelerator and the experiments be successfully completed in a timely manner. All necessary efforts should be devoted to achieving this goal. We also recall two of the principal recommendations of the 2019 ESPP for future accelerator initiatives, namely that 1) An electron-positron Higgs factory is the highest priority for the next collider (Rec. c). 2) Europe, together with its international partners, should investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with a centre-of-mass energy of at least 100 TeV and with an electron-positron Higgs and electroweak factory as a possible first stage (Rec. e). A major objective in particle physics is always to operate an accelerator that allows a leap of an order of magnitude in the constituent centre-of-mass energy with respect to the previous one. We support FCC-ee and FCC-hh as the preferred option for CERN future, as it addresses both of the above recommendations.   The guidance for the 2025 ESPP requests, in addition to the preferred option, the inclusion of ``prioritised alternatives to be pursued if the chosen preferred option turns out not to be feasible or competitive''. Proposed alternatives to the preferred FCC option include linear, muon colliders and LHeC accelerators. In response to this request we propose reusing the existing LHC tunnel for an electron-positron collider, called LEP3, as a back-up alternative if the FCC cannot proceed. LEP3 leverages much of the R\\&D conducted for FCC-ee, offers high-precision studies of Z, W, and Higgs bosons below the tt threshold, and offers potential physics performance comparable or superior to other fallback options at a lower cost while supporting continued R\\&D towards a next-generation energy frontier machine.",

    "title": "Exploring mechanisms leading to composition errors in monazite (CePO4)   analysed with atom probe tomography",
    "abstract": "Monazite (CePO4) is widely used in U-Th-Pb geochronology due to its reliable age determinations, although isotopic disturbances often require nanoscale investigation to better understand the mechanisms at play. Atom Probe Tomography (APT) offers unique capabilities for nanoscale chemical analysis and 3D atomic reconstruction but presents challenges for insulating materials such as CePO4, particularly due to oxygen loss during field evaporation. This study investigates the effects of laser wavelength, energy, metallic coatings and detection device on mass spectrum optimization and compositional accuracy in synthetic CePO4 samples. Results show that shorter laser wavelengths (260 nm) enhance peak resolution, particularly when combined with advanced reflectron configurations, as demonstrated with the LEAP 6000 XR. Chromium coatings further improve thermal dissipation and reduce noise levels. However, compositional measurements reveal systematic underestimation of oxygen and overestimation of P and Ce, likely influenced by preferential low-field element evaporation. These findings highlight the need to carefully tune experimental parameters to mitigate quantification biases and enhance the reliability of APT analyses for geological materials.",

    "title": "Pulse shape simulation for the reduced charge collection layer in p-type   high-purity germanium detectors",
    "abstract": "$P$-type high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors are widely used across many scientific domains, and current data analysis methods have served well in many use cases. However, applications like low-background experiments that search for rare physics, such as dark matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, could profit a lot from a more detailed understanding of the detector response close to the surface. The outer $n^+$ electrode of the $p$-type HPGe detector forms a layer with reduced charge collection, and events originating here can be a critical background source in such experiments. If the difference in detector pulse shape between detector surface and bulk events is known, it can be used to identify and veto these background events. However, a faithful simulation of the detector response in this surface region is difficult and has not been available as a standard method so far. We present a novel three-dimensional pulse shape simulation method for this reduced charge collection (RCC) layer. We have implemented this method as a new feature in the open-source simulation package \\emph{SolidStateDetectors.jl} and show a validation of the numerical simulation results with analytical calculations. An experimental study using a $p$-type HPGe detector also validates our approach. The current implementation supports $p$-type HPGe detectors of fairly arbitrary geometry, but is easily adaptable to $n$-type detectors by adjusting the impurity density profile of the layer. It should also be adaptable to other semiconductor materials in a straightforward fashion.",

Following a Monte Carlo study of internal shielding to suppress neutron multiple scattering in T-REX, the neutron transmission and scattering properties of 12 shielding-material samples have been measured at the ISIS spallation neutron source. Neutron transmission was measured on the EMMA beam line at wavelengths 0.5-4.7 A, using a 2D-position-sensitive, neutron GEM detector, while neutron scattering was measured for 6 of the samples at the Merlin spectrometer, at wavelengths 0.72, 1.28, 1.85 and 2.41 A.

It is the most recent detector developed by the NEXT collaboration to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay ($\\beta\\beta 0\\nu$) of Xe-136. The NEXT gas TPC technology offers the best energy resolution near the Q-value of the decay ($Q_{\\beta\\beta}$ = 2458 keV) among xenon detectors, which is set by design to be <1% FWHM. We report here the high-energy calibration of the detector using a Th-228 source, demonstrating linear response and an energy resolution of $(0.90 \\pm 0.02)$% FWHM at the Tl-208 photopeak (2615 keV). This performance extrapolates to a resolution at the double-beta decay end-point of $R(Q_{\\beta\\beta})$ = $(0.93 \\pm 0.02)$% FWHM, confirming the detector's capability for precision energy measurement in the search for $\\beta\\beta 0\\nu$.",

    "title": "Simulation of multi-species kinetic instabilities with the Numerical   Flow Iteration",
    "abstract": "Kinetic instabilities are one of the most challenging aspects in computational plasma physics. Accurately capturing their onset and evolution requires fine resolution of the high-dimensional distribution functions of each relevant species, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitively expensive. Additionally, plasma dynamics is an inherently multi-scale phenomenon due to the vast separation of scales between heavy ions and light-weight electrons. In previous work the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) was suggested as a high-fidelity alternative with reduced memory complexity making it an interesting candidate to simulate complicated kinetic instabilities. In this work we extend NuFI to non-periodic boundary conditions and demonstrate how it is possible to reduce the computational complexity to allow for longer simulation periods.",

    "title": "Laser diagnostics for negative ion source optimization: insights from   SPIDER at the ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility",
    "abstract": "The ITER Heating Neutral Beams (HNBs) require large, high-energy H/D atom beams (285/330 A/m^2 extracted current density, and 1/0.87 MeV acceleration energy, respectively for H and D). To address the associated challenges, the SPIDER negative ion RF beam source at the Neutral Beam Test Facility (NBTF) in Padova (Italy) serves as a full-scale source prototype with a 100 kV triode accelerator, for design validation and performance verification. SPIDER is equipped with two advanced laser diagnostics to monitor key plasma parameters; Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) is used to measure H$^-$\\slash D$^-$ ion densities, while Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (LAS) tracks caesium neutral density in the source. These measurements are essential for optimizing negative ion production and meeting ITER source targets. We present diagnostic upgrade details, recent experimental results, and correlations with other machine parameters. Since CRDS relies on a single 4.637-meter-long optical cavity, the longest used in such sources, it has demonstrated sensitivity to alignment. Based on recent experimental experience, structural improvements are being implemented to enhance both stability and measurement reliability. LAS has mainly been employed as a tool to monitor the caesium conditioning status of SPIDER. Additionally, due to a distributed measurement over four lines of sight, LAS has proven effective in monitoring the caesium distribution within the source. This work demonstrates the essential role of laser diagnostics in developing ITER-relevant plasma sources and informs ongoing efforts to improve measurement accuracy in challenging environments.",

    "title": "An exploratory study of a tellurium-loaded liquid scintillator based on   water and p-dioxane",
    "abstract": "Tellurium-loaded liquid scintillators are critical for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. However, conventional organic scintillators are constrained by the limited solubility of organic tellurium compounds compared with that of inorganic ones in water, whereas water-based scintillators are likely constrained by the destabilization of surfactants caused by inorganic tellurium compounds. In this work, a surfactant-free water-containing route is explored, in which an aqueous telluric acid solution is introduced into a water-miscible organic scintillator comprising p-dioxane, naphthalene, and PPO. The phase behavior of this system is mapped to delineate homogeneous-mixture domains and to estimate practical upper bounds on tellurium loading. Optical properties are characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The scintillation light yield is obtained with a relative method that compares to a reference LAB-PPO scintillator. The measurements demonstrate scintillation quenching induced by water and by tellurium acid. These results provide benchmarks for water-containing and surfactant-free formulations and support the development of high-loading liquid scintillators for future detector design.",

    "title": "Demonstrating the ability of IceCube DeepCore to probe Earth's interior   with atmospheric neutrino oscillations",
    "abstract": "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is an optical Cherenkov detector instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth's electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth's mass and moment of inertia.",

    "title": "Plasma Processing of FRIB Low-Beta Cryomodules using Higher-Order-Modes",
    "abstract": "Improvement in SRF accelerator performance after in-tunnel plasma processing has been seen at SNS and CEBAF. Plasma processing development for FRIB quarter-wave and half-wave resonators (QWRs, HWRs) was initiated in 2020. Plasma processing on individual QWRs (beta = 0.085) and HWRs (beta = 0.53) has been found to significantly reduce field emission. A challenge for the FRIB cavities is the relatively weak fundamental power coupler (FPC) coupling strength (chosen for efficient continuous-wave acceleration), which produces a lot of mismatch during plasma processing at room temperature. For FRIB QWRs, driving the plasma with higher-order modes (HOMs) is beneficial to reduce the FPC mismatch and increase the plasma density. The first plasma processing trial on a spare FRIB QWR cryomodule was done in January 2024, with before-and-after bunker tests and subsequent installation into the linac tunnel. The first in-tunnel plasma processing trial was completed in September 2025. For both cryomodules, before-and-after cold tests showed a significant increase in the average accelerating gradient for field emission onset after plasma processing for some cavities. In parallel with the cryomodule trials, the use of dual-drive plasma is being explored with the goal of improving the effectiveness of plasma processing.",

    "title": "Uncertainty Guided Online Ensemble for Non-stationary Data Streams in   Fusion Science",
    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams. Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model. Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and 10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.",

    "title": "Detecting Shearless Phase-Space Transport Barriers in Global Gyrokinetic   Turbulence Simulations with Test Particle Map Models",
    "abstract": "In magnetically confined fusion plasmas, the role played by zonal E$\\times$B flow shear layers in the suppression of turbulent transport is relatively well-understood. However, less is understood about the role played by the weak shear regions that arise in the non-monotonic radial electric field profiles often associated with these shear layers. In electrostatic simulations from the global total-f gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code XGC, we demonstrate how shearless regions with non-zero flow curvature form zonal \"jets\" that, in conjunction with neighboring regions of shear, can act as robust barriers to particle transport and turbulence spreading. By isolating quasi-coherent fluctuations radially localized to the zonal jets, we construct a map model for the Lagrangian dynamics of gyrokinetic test particles in the presence of drift waves. We identify the presence of shearless invariant tori in this model and verify that these tori act as partial phase-space transport barriers in the simulations. We also demonstrate how avalanches impinging on these shearless tori cause reconnection events that form \"cold/warm core ring\" structures analogous to those found in oceanic jets, facilitating transport across the barriers without destroying them completely. We discuss how shearless tori may generically arise from tertiary instabilities or other types of discrete eigenmodes, suggesting their potential relevance to broader classes of turbulent fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "To address the long-standing unresolved issue of \"isotope effect\" in plasma transport, this study investigates the hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) isotope dependence of a nonlinear turbulence system. The analysis focuses on the zonal flow (ZF) activity, turbulence properties, their nonlinear interaction, and resulting turbulent transport in a torus plasma. ZF activity, observed in low-density electron cyclotron heating plasmas in Heliotron J, is enhanced with increasing D gas fraction from 10 to 80 percent. While the turbulence scale size in the edge region (rho approx 0.8) is larger in D plasmas, the reduction and decoupling of fluctuations, associated with an enhanced ZF, results in beneficial impacts on turbulent transport, driven by an enhanced nonlinear coupling between the ZF and turbulence in D plasmas. These differences in the turbulence nature lead to the significant reduction of turbulence-induced transport observed in the D plasma. These comprehensive observations suggest that the isotope dependence on the turbulence system is essential for explaining the isotope effect on confinement improvement and is vital in predicting the performance of future fusion reactors.",

    "title": "Unified Model of Heated Plasma Expansion",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the need to predict plasma density and temperature distributions created in the early stages of high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, we develop a fluid model of plasma expansion into vacuum that incorporates external heating. We propose a new three-parameter family of self-similar solutions for plasma expansion that models a wide range of spatiotemporal variations of the electron temperature. Depending on the relative scales of the heated plasma domain $L$, the Debye length $\\lambda_D$ and an emergent ion-acoustic correlation length $\\lambda_s$, characterized by the parameters $\\lambda_s/\\lambda_D$ and $L/\\lambda_s$, a spectrum of dynamical behaviors for the expanding plasma are identified. The behavior is classified into five dynamical regimes, ranging from nearly quasineutral expansion to the formation of bare ion slabs susceptible to Coulomb explosion. The limiting self-similar solutions are analyzed, and the dynamics in the five asymptotic limits in the parameter space are detailed. Scaling relations for the length scales and energies of the expanding plasma are proposed. The self-similar framework is applied to laser-plasma interactions, specifically addressing the plasma dynamics at a target surface during prepulse-target interactions. The results offer insights into the expansion behavior based on the laser-plasma parameters, and scaling relations for optimizing laser-plasma schemes and guiding experimental designs in high-intensity laser experiments.",

    "title": "First results of the NEXT-100 detector using $^{83m}$Kr decays",
    "abstract": "We report here the first results obtained with NEXT-100 using low-energy calibration data from $^{83m}$Kr decays, which allow mapping of the detector response in the active volume and monitoring of its stability over time. After homogenizing the light response, we achieve an energy resolution of 4.37% FWHM at 41.5 keV for $^{83m}$Kr point-like energy deposits contained in a radius of 425 mm. In a fiducial region representing the operating conditions of NEXT-100 at 10 bar we obtain an improved energy resolution of 4.16% FWHM. These results are in good agreement with that obtained in NEXT-White, and an $E^{-1/2}$ extrapolation to $Q_{\\beta\\beta}$ yields an energy resolution close to 0.5% FWHM, well below the 1% FWHM design target.",

    "title": "Particle background characterization and prediction for the NUCLEUS   reactor CE$ν$NS experiment",
    "abstract": "NUCLEUS is a cryogenic detection experiment which aims to measure Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\\nu$NS) and to search for new physics at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France. This article reports on the prediction of particle-induced backgrounds, especially focusing on the sub-keV energy range, which is a poorly known region where most of the CE$\\nu$NS signal from reactor antineutrinos is expected. Together with measurements of the environmental background radiations at the experimental site, extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the Geant4 package were run both to optimize the experimental setup for background reduction and to estimate the residual rates arising from different contributions such as cosmic ray-induced radiations, environmental gammas and material radioactivity. The NUCLEUS experimental setup is predicted to achieve a total rejection power of more than two orders of magnitude, leaving a residual background component which is strongly dominated by cosmic ray-induced neutrons. In the CE$\\nu$NS signal region of interest between 10 and 100 eV, a total particle background rate of $\\sim$ 250 d$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$keV$^{-1}$ is expected in the CaWO$_4$ target detectors. This corresponds to a signal-to-background ratio $\\gtrsim$ 1, and therefore meets the required specifications in terms of particle background rejection for the detection of reactor antineutrinos through CE$\\nu$NS.",

    "abstract": "We present CaloClouds3, a model for the fast simulation of photon showers in the barrel of a high granularity detector. This iteration demonstrates for the first time how a pointcloud model can employ angular conditioning to replicate photons at all incident angles. Showers produced by this model can be used across the whole detector barrel, due to specially produced position agnostic training data. With this flexibility, the model is usable in a full simulation and reconstruction chain, which offers a further handle for evaluating physics performance of the model. As inference time is a crucial consideration for a generative model, the pre-processing and hyperparameters are aggressively optimised, achieving a speed up factor of two orders of magnitude over Geant4 at inference.",

    "abstract": "Double beta plus decay is a rare nuclear disintegration process. Difficulties in its measurement arise from suppressed decay probabilities, experimentally challenging decay signatures and low natural abundances of suitable candidate nuclei. In this presentation, we propose NuDoubt++, a new detector concept to overcome these challenges. It is based on the first-time combination of hybrid and opaque scintillation detector technology paired with novel light read-out techniques. This approach is particularly suitable detecting positron (beta plus) signatures. We expect to discover two-neutrino double beta plus decay modes within 1 tonne-week exposure and are able to probe neutrinoless double beta plus decays at several orders of magnitude improved significance compared to current experimental limits.",

Currently, most research involving tissue impedance is based on bulky or fixed-purpose hardware, which limits the scope of research and the possibilities of experiments.

An event-based sub-sampler improves storage and energy efficiency for long-term recording. In addition to the versatile SoC, the digital back-end and behavioral models of the analog front-end are open-source, allowing fast system-level simulations or repurposing. The SoC was taped out on TSMC 65 nm LP process.",

The occupancy induced by the beam-beam background is evaluated for each scenario, validating the compatibility of the existing SiD detector design with operations at C$^3$ without substantial modifications. At the same time, the modular simulation framework and analysis methodology presented in this paper offer a versatile toolkit for background studies in future collider proposals, contributing to a common platform for different machine designs.",

    "abstract": "Structures in tokamak plasmas are elongated along the direction of the magnetic field and short in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. Many tokamak simulation codes take advantage of this by using a field aligned coordinate system. However, field aligned coordinate systems have a coordinate singularity at magnetic X-points where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes, which makes it difficult to use field aligned coordinate systems when simulating the core and scrape-off layer (SOL) simultaneously. Here we present an algorithm for computing geometric quantities in a standard field aligned coordinate system that avoids the singularity and allows one to conduct 2D axisymmetric simulations in X-point geometries. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm with an example simulation of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP).",

    "title": "Fourier Transform Method Of A Detailed Configuration Accounting In Hot   Plasma Bound-Bound Opacity Calculations",
    "abstract": "G.~Hazak and J.~Kurzweil discovered a method of configurational resolution of transition arrays for the Super Transition Arrays approach to the bound-bound opacity calculation. Their method is based on the representation of the photoabsorption coefficient as the Fourier transform, the linearity of the transition energy between configurations with respect to shell occupation numbers, and factorization of the probabilities of configurations on shell occupation numbers. We extend the Hazak -- Kurzweil method for the calculations with Detailed Configuration Accounting. The resulting expressions for the bound-bound opacity represent an alternative to the widely used ones and are quite convenient for numerical implementation.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the sawtooth crash phenomenon in tokamak plasmas by modelling it as a sequence of Multi-region Relaxed Magnetohydrodynamic (MRxMHD) equilibria. Using the Stepped-Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC), we constructed a series of equilibria representing intermediate states during the sawtooth crash, with progressively increasing reconnection regions. Numerical results demonstrated that the system prefers the lower energy non-axisymmetric equilibria with islands and is eventually back to an axisymmetric state, capturing key features of the reconnection process. Comparisons with the nonlinear MHD code M3D-C1 showed remarkable agreement on the field-line topology, the safety factor, and the current profile. However, the simplified MRxMHD model does not resolve the detailed structure of the current sheet. Despite this limitation, MRxMHD offers an insightful approach and a complementary perspective to initial-value MHD simulations.",

    "abstract": "Electronic stopping power models describing fuel heating processes in inertial fusion energy concepts typically assume linear-response behavior through quadratic scaling with the projectile charge. We report the results of real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicating that even for low-Z ions, nonlinear processes modify stopping powers in warm dense matter by about 10% near and below the Bragg peak. By describing partial neutralization of slow ions, analytic effective charge models capture some qualitative aspects of the TDDFT results but do not always offer quantitative accuracy. Cases where the effective charge inferred from TDDFT exceeds the bare ion charge suggest that more complex nonlinear effects also contribute. These findings will inform future improvements to more efficient stopping power models.",

They are based on a prism-shaped scintillator with corner-mounted SiPMs. Previous work has demonstrated that analytic algorithms based on a physical model of light propagation can reconstruct particle impinging positions and tracks and estimate deposited energy and Linear Energy Transfer (LET) with moderate accuracy. In this study, we enhance this approach by applying machine learning (ML) methods, specifically gradient boosting techniques, to improve the accuracy of spatial location and energy deposition estimation. Using the GEANT4 simulation toolkit, we simulated cosmic muons and energetic oxygen ions traversing an SSPD, we trained XGBoost and LightGBM models to predict particle impinging positions and deposited energy. Both algorithms outperformed the analytic baseline. We further investigated hybrid strategies, including hybrid boosting and probing. While hybrid boosting provided no significant improvement, probing yielded measurable gains in both position and LET estimation. These results suggest that ML-driven reconstruction provides a powerful enhancement to SSPD performance.",

    "abstract": "The ZaP-HD sheared-flow-stabilized (SFS) Z-pinch device is a testbed for experimental investigation of plasma-electrode interactions. The graphite electrode is exposed to a high temperature, high density Z-pinch plasma while supplying large pinch currents. In-situ measurements of the gross carbon erosion flux obtained with S/XB spectroscopy exceed the expected flux from physical sputtering, but have reasonable agreement with the expected sublimation flux. Comparison of the ionization mean free paths of neutrals produced through both erosion processes shows that sublimated carbon is ionized within the sheath while sputtered carbon is ionized beyond the sheath. This suggests a process of electrode recycling and self-healing through redeposition. The sputtered carbon is primarily responsible for net erosion. Ex-situ analysis of electrode material is enabled by the design of a removable coupon. Three different plasma exposure conditions varied the pinch current and number of pulses. Net mass loss measurements support the physical picture of electrode recycling. Erosion rates range from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/C, which are comparable to existing arc discharge devices. Measurements of the microscopic surface morphology and roughness reveal irregular consolidated structures and general smoothing except at high particle fluence. Crack formation suggests the importance of repetitive thermal cycles. Definitive features of sputtering such as pitting and cratering are absent, although further study is needed to attribute the observed changes to other processes. These results indicate some alignment with erosion processes in high-powered arc discharges, which successfully operate solid electrodes in extreme environments. This provides confidence in managing electrode erosion in the SFS Z-pinch configuration.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Full Damage Profile of Focused Ion Beams via 4D-STEM   Precession Electron Diffraction and PSNR Metrics",
    "abstract": "Focused ion beams (FIBs) are widely used in nanofabrication for applications such as circuit repair, ultra-thin lamella preparation, strain engineering, and quantum device prototyping. Although the lateral spread of the ion beam is often overlooked, it becomes critical in precision tasks such as impurity placement in host substrates, where accurate knowledge of the ion-matter interaction profile is essential. Existing techniques typically characterise only the beam core, where most ions land, thus underestimating the full extent of the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we use four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<$0.1 ions nm$^{-2}$. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns were collected in calibration regions with known ion fluence and compared to patterns acquired around static dwell spots exposed to a 30 keV Ga$^{+}$ beam for 1-10 s. Cross-correlation using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artefacts than conventional dark-field imaging. This approach is complementary to image resolution methods enabling a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes, offering a more accurate representation of FIB performance and supporting application tailoring beyond the conventional resolution metrics focused solely on the beam core.",

    "abstract": "While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\\sigma \\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\\sigma < 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.",

We work in the regime of electron hydrodynamics and account for interlayer correlations of charge puddle disorder. The drag resistivity is expressed in terms of the viscosity, intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, and the correlation function of the puddle disorder. The contributions of the interlayer transfer of momentum and energy to drag have opposite signs. This leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the drag resistivity on the carrier density. For layer-symmetric doping, the drag resistivity changes sign as a function of the carrier density. At interlayer separations shorter than the disorder correlation length, the transconductivity saturates to the disorder-induced enhancement of the intralayer conductivity. We provide quantitative estimates of the effect for Dirac electron liquids in monolayer graphene and bilayer graphene double-layer devices.",

Their frequency shift is slightly less than the frequency of a nominal, pure ion-plasma wave associated with electron critical density, where an ion-acoustic wave would be expected. We explain this as the result of a substantial reduction of Debye shielding as the intense optical fields compete to drive electrons in large-amplitude oscillations. This general effect leads to a larger, dynamical and anisotropic Debye length, which should have a broad impact on plasma physics in this regime.",

    "abstract": "We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\\kappa$ tails for $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\\bf v}_E \\cdot {\\bf \\kappa}$, with ${\\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\\bf\\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.",

    "abstract": "In stellarators, achieving effective divertor configurations is challenging due to the three-dimensional nature of the magnetic fields, which often leads to chaotic field lines and fuzzy separatrices. This work presents a novel approach to directly optimize modular stellarator coils for a sharp X-point divertor topology akin to the Large Helical Device's (LHD) helical divertor using a target plasma surface with sharp corners. By minimizing the normal magnetic field component on this surface, we target a clean separatrix with minimal chaos. Notably, this approach demonstrates the first LHD-like helical divertor design using optimized modular coils instead of helical coils. Separatrices are produced with significantly lower chaos than in LHD, demonstrating that a wide chaotic layer is not intrinsic to the helical divertor. Additional optimization methods are implemented to improve engineering feasibility of the coils and reduce chaos, including weighted quadrature and manifold optimization, a method which does not rely on normal field minimization. The results outline several new strategies for divertor design in stellarators, though it remains to achieve these edge divertor features at the same time as internal field qualities like quasisymmetry.",

    "abstract": "We present here an optimisation and demonstration of a wide band instrument capable of measuring localised and directionally alternated magnetic fields below pT in the very high frequency (VHF) range. We take advantage of the magnon-photon hybridization between a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a copper resonant cavity to employ a resonant heterodyne detection scheme. The measurement is near instantaneous due to the strong coupling attained between magnons and photons.In this work measurements are reported showing a significant widening of the measurement bandwidth, obtained by tuning the YIG Larmor frequency with a bias magnetic field and adjusting the magnon-photon coupling strength. Minimum sensitivity in the sub pT regime is demonstrated in the range 150 -- 225 MHz at room temperature and expected to go to fT in cryogenic temperatures. Dynamic range is estimated to be above 100 dB. The sensitivity is found to be independent on size, being ready to in-chip miniaturization.

    "title": "Sensor operating point calibration and monitoring of the ALICE Inner   Tracking System during LHC Run 3",
    "abstract": "The new Inner Tracking System (ITS2) of the ALICE experiment began operation in 2021 with the start of LHC Run 3. Compared to its predecessor, ITS2 offers substantial improvements in pointing resolution, tracking efficiency at low transverse momenta, and readout-rate capabilities. The detector employs silicon Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) featuring a pixel size of 26.88$\\times$29.24 $\\mu$m$^2$ and an intrinsic spatial resolution of approximately 5 $\\mu$m. With a remarkably low material budget of 0.36% of radiation length ($X_{0}$) per layer in the three innermost layers and a total sensitive area of about 10 m$^2$, the ITS2 constitutes the largest-scale application of MAPS technology in a high-energy physics experiment and the first of its kind operated at the LHC. For stable data taking, it is crucial to calibrate different parameters of the detector, such as in-pixel charge thresholds and the masking of noisy pixels. The calibration of 24120 monolithic sensors, comprising a total of 12.6$\\times$10$^{9}$ pixels, represents a major operational challenge. This paper presents the methods developed for the calibration of the ITS2 and outlines the strategies for monitoring and dynamically adjusting the detector's key performance parameters over time.",

    "title": "Rapid Inference of Logic Gate Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection in   High Energy Physics",
    "abstract": "The increasing data rates and complexity of detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) necessitate fast and efficient machine learning models, particularly for rapid selection of what data to store, known as triggering. Building on recent work in differentiable logic gates, we present a public implementation of a Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Neural Network (CLGN). We apply this to detecting anomalies at the Level-1 Trigger at CMS using public data from the CICADA project. We demonstrate that the CLGN achieves physics performance on par with or superior to conventional quantized neural networks. We also synthesize an LGN for a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and show highly promising FPGA characteristics, notably zero Digital Signal Processor (DSP) resource usage. This work highlights the potential of logic gate networks for high-speed, on-detector inference in High Energy Physics and beyond.",

    "title": "Plasma Processing Of SRF Cavities at Jefferson Lab: Experiment Results   and Simulation Insight",
    "abstract": "Plasma processing of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities has been an active research effort at Jefferson Lab (JLab) since 2019, aimed at enhancing cavity performance by removing hydrocarbon contaminants and reducing field emission. In this experiment, processing using argon-oxygen and helium-oxygen gas mixtures to find minimum ignition power at different cavity pressure was investigated. Ongoing simulations are contributing to a better understanding of the plasma surface interactions and the fundamental physics behind the process. These simulations, combined with experimental studies, guide the optimization of key parameters such as gas type, RF power, and pressure to ignite plasma using selected higher-order mode (HOM) frequencies. This paper presents experimental data from argon-oxygen and helium-oxygen gas mixture C75 and C100 cavity plasma ignition studies, as well as simulation results for the C100-type cavity based on the COMSOL model previously applied to the C75 cavity.",
