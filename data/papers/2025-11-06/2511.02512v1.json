  "title": "Neutron Neutron Interaction Properties of Structural Materials for   Multi-Grid Neutron Detectors",
  "abstract": "The T-REX neutron time-of-flight spectrometer at the European Spallation Source will use Multi-Grid Technology, which relies on thin B4C coatings on the Al blades of the grids to detect scattered thermal neutrons. Following a Monte Carlo study of internal shielding to suppress neutron multiple scattering in T-REX, the neutron transmission and scattering properties of 12 shielding-material samples have been measured at the ISIS spallation neutron source. Neutron transmission was measured on the EMMA beam line at wavelengths 0.5-4.7 A, using a 2D-position-sensitive, neutron GEM detector, while neutron scattering was measured for 6 of the samples at the Merlin spectrometer, at wavelengths 0.72, 1.28, 1.85 and 2.41 A. The present tests show that a B4C/Al composite material, plated with Ni to stop intrinsic alpha background, is an effective neutron absorber, suitable for incorporation in the Multi-Grid structures which detect the neutrons in inelastic neutron spectrometers .",
