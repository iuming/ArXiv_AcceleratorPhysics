  "title": "Production of High-Specific-Activity Radioisotopes Using High-Energy   Fusion Neutrons",
  "abstract": "We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion can produce many medically important radioisotopes-including $^{99}$Mo/${}^{99\\mathrm{m}}\\mathrm{Tc}$, $^{131}$I, $^{177}$Lu, $^{153}$Sm, $^{111}$In, $^{133}$Xe, $^{32}$P, $^{64}$Cu, $^{60}$Co, $^{103}$Pd, $^{89}$Sr, $^{188}$Re, $^{117}$In/$^{117\\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{90}$Y, and $^{166}$Ho - and emerging isotopes such as $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\\mathrm{m}}$Pt, $^{47}$Sc, ${}^{103}\\mathrm{Ru}/{}^{103\\mathrm{m}}\\mathrm{Rh}$, ${}^{103}\\mathrm{Pd}/{}^{103\\mathrm{m}}\\mathrm{Rh}$, and $^{119}$Sb with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical rather than isotopic separation. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.",
