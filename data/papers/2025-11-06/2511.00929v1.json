  "title": "Performance of resistive MPGDs with pad readout coupled to VMM3a ASIC",
  "abstract": "We present a comparative study of three resistive Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD) technologies - Micromegas, RPWELL, and $\\mu\\mathrm{-RWELL}$ - with VMM3a based readout, using relativistic muons and pions. The Micromegas and the RPWELL were operated in $\\mathrm{Ar/CO_2/iC_4H_{10}}$ gas mixture, while the $\\mu\\mathrm{-RWELL}$ in $\\mathrm{Ar/CO_2/CF_4}$ (greenhouse gas containing mixture). All detectors operated stably exceeding 96% efficiency. The usage of continuous readout enabled studies of detector electrical instabilities in- and off-beam at near breakdown voltages. Each technology has different advantages making it more suitable for various experimental conditions.",
