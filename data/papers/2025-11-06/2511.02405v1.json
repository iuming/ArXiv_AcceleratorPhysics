  "title": "Simulation of multi-species kinetic instabilities with the Numerical   Flow Iteration",
  "abstract": "Kinetic instabilities are one of the most challenging aspects in computational plasma physics. Accurately capturing their onset and evolution requires fine resolution of the high-dimensional distribution functions of each relevant species, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitively expensive. Additionally, plasma dynamics is an inherently multi-scale phenomenon due to the vast separation of scales between heavy ions and light-weight electrons. In previous work the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) was suggested as a high-fidelity alternative with reduced memory complexity making it an interesting candidate to simulate complicated kinetic instabilities. In this work we extend NuFI to non-periodic boundary conditions and demonstrate how it is possible to reduce the computational complexity to allow for longer simulation periods.",
