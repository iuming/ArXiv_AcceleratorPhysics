  "title": "Rapid Inference of Logic Gate Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection in   High Energy Physics",
  "abstract": "The increasing data rates and complexity of detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) necessitate fast and efficient machine learning models, particularly for rapid selection of what data to store, known as triggering. Building on recent work in differentiable logic gates, we present a public implementation of a Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Neural Network (CLGN). We apply this to detecting anomalies at the Level-1 Trigger at CMS using public data from the CICADA project. We demonstrate that the CLGN achieves physics performance on par with or superior to conventional quantized neural networks. We also synthesize an LGN for a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and show highly promising FPGA characteristics, notably zero Digital Signal Processor (DSP) resource usage. This work highlights the potential of logic gate networks for high-speed, on-detector inference in High Energy Physics and beyond.",
