  "title": "MOSAIX Qualification System for ALICE ITS3",
  "abstract": "The ALICE Inner Tracking System upgrade (ITS3) will employ stitched, wafer-scale Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) for the first time in high-energy physics. MOSAIX, a fully functional prototype and the final development step before production, measures 266 mm by 19 mm. The chip integrates 144 independently powered pixel matrices, eight 10 Gb/s transmitters, and on-chip power and data distribution. This contribution presents the development of the MOSAIX test system and verification strategy, with emphasis on validating the testing infrastructure before chip availability. The system includes an FPGA that controls MOSAIX and parses its output, and a second MOSAIX emulator FPGA.",
