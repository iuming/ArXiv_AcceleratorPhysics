  "title": "Aspects of Mechanical Engineering for Undulators",
  "abstract": "This paper gives an overview about aspects of mechanical engineering of undulators. It is based mainly on two types that are used in the SwissFEL facility. The U15 Undulator is an example of an in-vacuum type and the UE38 is an APPLE-X type. It describes the frame, the adjustment of the magnets with flexible keepers and the adjustment of the whole device with eccentric movers.",
