  "title": "Relativistic electron dynamics in ultra-intense lasers",
  "abstract": "These lectures at Winter School on Intense Laser Science (WiSILS-2024) at IIT Jodhpur, India, will focus on the Relativistic charge particle dynamics in ultra-intense laser pulses. We will be learning about the relativistic equations of motion, Radiation-Reaction, Thomson scattering, Ponderomotive scattering, and its usage as the potential diagnostic tool. A simulation code LEADS will address the relativistic electron dynamics in the intense-laser pulse.",
