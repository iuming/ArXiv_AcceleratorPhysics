    "title": "Corrections for systematic errors in slit-profiler transverse phase space measurements",
    "abstract": "In photo injectors, the transverse emittance is one of the key measures of beam quality as it defines the possible performance of the whole facility. As such it is important to measure the emittance in photo injectors and ensure the accuracy of these measurements. While there are many different methods of measuring the emittance, this paper focuses on quantifying the systematic errors present in transverse phase space measurements taken with slit-profiler methods, i.e. scanning a narrow slit over the beam and continually measuring the passed beamlets' divergence with a downstream profiler. The measurement errors include effects of the slit size, beamlet imaging, and residual space charge. While these effects are generally small, they can have significant impact on the measured emittance when the 2D phase space is strongly coupled. The systematic effects studied and corrections are demonstrated with simulations and measurements from the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) using a slit-screen emittance scanner.",

    "title": "Active interrogation of underground piezoelectric fabrics using high energy muon beams propagating across seismogenic faults",
    "abstract": "In this paper we extend a previous analysis of a newly conceived technique based on active interrogation of tectonic stress evolution in regions hosting active seismogenic faults. The aim is to monitor and detect stable and reliable precursor signals on an adequate time scale, well before an earthquake event, that can play a crucial role in activating alarms for civil protection systems. The precursor signal relies on continuous measurements of the time evolution of tectonic stress, obtained by interrogating underground, with a high energy collimated muon beam, the piezoelectric fabrics present in quartz rich granite like rocks surrounding a known seismogenic fault in the Earth crust. Beam propagation through the rock across the active fault conveys to a detector at the exit of the traversal information on the amplitude of the piezoelectric field, which scales with the tectonic stress applied to quartz crystals embedded in the rock. The system, named ERMES (Earthquake Reconnaissance using Muon beam Evolution in Silicon dioxide), differs from other techniques under study detecting electromagnetic signals generated by piezoelectricity outside the Earth crust, as it probes piezoelectric effects directly inside the source region of the associated electromagnetic field, namely the near field within quartz crystals rather than the far field in open space. We present a focused analysis of muon beam manipulation after rock traversal and before detection using a newly conceived muonic lens, and we explore the maximum rock penetration capability of a high energy muon beam, reaching about 3 km of rock thickness for a 10 TeV beam. Owing to the peculiarity of muon propagation through such kilometer scale targets, we cross checked previous FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations with Geant4 to clarify the secondary muons role generated by primary muon interactions in solid matter over long propagation lengths.",

The setup is under preparation at Roma Tre and it has a volume of 40 L liquid argon, which is liquefied from argon gas with a purity of $\\ge 99.9999\\%$ vol. To readout the scintillation photons from liquid argon with the highest intensity near 127 nm, we use the vacuum ultraviolet silicon photomultipliers from Hamamatsu.

    "title": "A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Textbook Model",
    "abstract": "An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.   I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \\cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "High-temperature technical superconductors are potential candidates for compact and high-field tokamak magnets. The demand for higher fusion power can be met with an on-axis high magnetic field due to toroidal magnets. An R&D activity has been initiated at the Institute for Plasma Research, India, to develop a compact D-shaped superconducting magnet utilizing REBCO high-temperature superconducting tapes. Under this initiative, a toroidal configuration with a major radius of 0.42 m, consisting of eight D-shaped, four poloidal field, and a central solenoid high-temperature superconducting magnets producing an on-axis toroidal magnetic field of 0.23 T has been conceptualized. The fabrication feasibility of a D-shaped coil for this toroidal configuration also envisaged using stacked high-temperature superconducting cable. In this paper, we report the design of a compact D-shaped coil, the fabrication of a long length HTS cable, a winding pack, and its integration with a cryogenic casing and vacuum enclosure. The winding pack terminations, joints, its interfacing with the power supply, and performance testing are also reported in this paper.",

    "title": "Asymmetric Electrostatic Dodecapole: Compact Bandpass Filter with Low Aberrations for Momentum Microscopy",
    "abstract": "Imaging energy filters in photoelectron microscopes and momentum microscopes use spherical fields with deflection angles of 90°, 180°, and even 2 x 180°. These instruments are optimized for high energy resolution, but exhibit image aberrations when operated in high transmission mode at medium energy resolution. Here we present a new approach for bandpass-filtered imaging in real or reciprocal space using an electrostatic dodecapole with an asymmetric electrode array. In addition to energy-dispersive beam deflection, this multipole allows aberration correction up to the 3rd order. Here we describe its use as a bandpass prefilter in a time-of-flight momentum microscope at the hard X-ray beamline P22 of PETRA III. The entire instrument is housed in a straight vacuum tube because the deflection angle is only 4° and the beam displacement in the filter is only 8 mm. The multipole is framed by transfer lenses in the entrance and exit branches. Two sets of 16 different sized entrance and exit apertures on piezomotor driven mounts allow selection of the desired bandpass. For pass energies between 100 and 1400 eV and slit widths between 0.5 and 4 mm the transmitted kinetic energy intervals are between 10 eV and a few hundred eV (FWHM). The filter eliminates all higher or lower energy signals outside the selected bandpass, significantly improving the signal-to-background ratio in the ToF analyzer.",

    "title": "Effect of hole pitch reduction on electron transport and diffusion: A comparative simulation study of Triple GEM detectors",
    "abstract": "Advances in fabrication techniques and high-performance electronics have facilitated the development of fine-pitch Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs). Earlier experimental and simulation findings suggest that these reduced-pitch GEMs can outperform the standard configuration in terms of effective gain, collection efficiency, and position resolution. However, a noticeable fraction of avalanche electrons is lost within the GEM systems, resulting in a degradation of charge collection efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive simulation-based study is essential to provide deeper insights into the extent of degradation and its contributing factors. In this context, we employ ANSYS and Garfield++ to model the Triple GEM detectors with reduced pitch sizes of 90 and 60 $μ$m, and perform a comparative performance analysis with the standard configuration (pitch size: 140 $μ$m). At first, the simulation framework is validated by comparing the results of the standard configuration with available experimental data and previously reported simulation outcomes. Despite the characteristic gain offset, the framework remains physically consistent and reliable in capturing microscopic avalanche dynamics, reproducing the experimental trend. Following validation, we investigate electron losses at the metal electrodes and within the Kapton holes, electron transmission through the transfer and induction regions, electron diffusion on the induction electrode, and the overall collection efficiency. These parameters are analyzed as functions of GEM potential, outer hole diameter, inner hole diameter, Kapton thickness, metal thickness, and gas composition, thereby offering insights for designing efficient GEM detectors.",

    "abstract": "Zinc sulfide (ZnS:Ag) scintillators coated with a thin 10B layer are widely used for ultracold neutron (UCN) detection, but their application is limited by long decay times and significant phosphorescence. We investigated two possible replacement scintillators: yttrium aluminum perovskite (YAP:Ce) and lutetium ttrium orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce). Both exhibit decay times on the order of 30-40 ns, which can help reduce dead time in high-count-rate experiments. YAP:Ce showed approximately 60% lower phosphorescence than ZnS:Ag after 2 days and detected about 20% more UCN. In contrast, LYSO:Ce exhibited higher phosphorescence and produced fewer UCN counts compared to both ZnS:Ag and YAP:Ce. While both tested scintillators are capable UCN detectors, YAP:Ce consistently outperformed LYSO:Ce across all measured performance metrics.",

    "title": "CycleGAN-Driven Transfer Learning for Electronics Response Emulation in High-Purity Germanium Detectors",
    "abstract": "High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are a key technology for rare-event searches such as neutrinoless double-beta decay (\\ensuremath{0νββ}) and dark matter experiments. Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction topology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse shape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that distinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable simulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of first-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics, requiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to accurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic Positional U-Net (https://github.com/aobol/CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so that they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this {Response Emulation Network} (REN) learns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high fidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact (ICPC) geometry to show that \\texttt{CPU-Net} effectively captures and reproduces critical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without detector-specific tuning. \\texttt{CPU-Net} achieves up to a factor-of-four improvement in distribution-level agreement for pulse shape parameter reconstruction, while preserving the topology-dependent information required for pulse-shape discrimination.",

Considering the moderately harsh radiation environment expected in the dRICH detector, this study reports on proton irradiation tests performed on key components of the RDO card to assess their tolerance to cumulative Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effects (SEE). All tested components demonstrated radiation tolerance beyond the TID levels expected for the dRICH environment, with the exception of the ATtiny417 microcontroller, which showed destructive failure.

    "title": "Cyclotron Radiation Signal Characterization in Resonant Cavities for the Project 8 Neutrino Mass Experiment",
    "abstract": "Many experimental methods in physics require understanding radiation from single particles into non-trivial electromagnetic mode structures. Such characterization is critical for Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), an advancing new measurement technique that has the potential to greatly benefit fundamental physics measurements. In CRES, charged particles emit cyclotron radiation at frequencies that provide their energy measurement. As a notable example, the Project 8 experiment aims to kinematically infer the neutrino mass by measuring the energies of electrons emitted in tritium beta decay using CRES. In near-term realizations of Project 8, resonant cylindrical cavities will be used for CRES readout, in a configuration with a magnetic field oriented along the symmetry axis, and electrons following helical cyclotron trajectories confined to the cavity interior. The physics of electromagnetic radiation in these environments is complicated, since it involves both the motion of the emitting particle and the mode structure imposed by the cavity. In this work, we derive and validate an analytic model for how an oscillating, trapped electron radiates into cavity modes, and the power and frequency content of the radiation that can be read out from these events. These results can be used to guide the design of cavities for future CRES and other experiments.",

    "abstract": "We present a detailed study of an 8-channel $1\\times1$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV hadron beam and 120 GeV muon beam at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron H6 beamline. Following up on our first detailed characterization of the efficiency and response of an SMSPD fabricated on a 3 nm WSi film, we report measurements of enhanced particle detection efficiency using a sensor fabricated from a thicker 4.7nm-thick WSi film. We also report the first SMSPD detection efficiency measurement made for muons. Measurements are enabled by a silicon tracking telescope providing 10 $μ$m in-situ spatial resolution. The results show a fill factor-normalized detection efficiency of 75% and a time resolution of about 130 ps across pixels. These findings represent a significant advancement toward developing high-efficiency SMSPD charged particle tracking systems with simultaneous precision timing, with potential applications in future accelerator-based experiments such as the FCC-ee and Muon Collider.",

    "title": "Muon tracking in a LiquidO opaque scintillator detector",
    "abstract": "LiquidO is an innovative radiation detector concept. The core idea is to exploit stochastic light confinement in a highly scattering medium to self-segment the detector volume. In this paper, we demonstrate event-by-event muon tracking in a LiquidO opaque scintillator detector prototype. The detector consists of a 30 mm cubic scintillator volume instrumented with 64 wavelength-shifting fibres arranged in an 8$\\times$8 grid with a 3.2 mm pitch and read out by silicon photomultipliers. A wax-based opaque scintillator with a scattering length of approximately 0.5 mm is used. The tracking performance of this LiquidO detector is characterised with cosmic-ray muons and the position resolution is demonstrated to be 450 $μ$m per row of fibres. These results highlight the potential of LiquidO opaque scintillator detectors to achieve fine spatial resolution, enabling precise particle tracking and imaging.",

    "title": "Characterization of Silicon-Membrane TES Microcalorimeters for Large-Format X-ray Spectrometers with Integrated Microwave SQUID Readout",
    "abstract": "We present the electro-thermal characterization of transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors suspended on Si membranes fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer.   This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies. The new instrument will allow for fast RIXS measurements to be made without causing sample damage. We verify the detector models and measure the energy resolution using a pulsed optical laser, demonstrating the viability of this approach for the final instrument to be deployed at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).",

    "title": "Comparison of plasma response models for RMP effects on the divertor and scrape-off layer in KSTAR",
    "abstract": "Resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) are beneficial for control of edge localized modes (ELMs) in tokamaks. Nevertheless, a side effect is the appearance of a helical striations in the particle and heat loads onto divertor targets. The extent and field line connection of these striations is significantly altered by the plasma response to external perturbations. For an ELM suppressed H-mode plasma at KSTAR, magnetic footprints are computed by FLARE based on plasma response from GPEC, MARS-F, M3D-C1 and JOREK with substantial differences in the resulting footprints (from 2 cm to 14 cm). This is reflected in EMC3-EIRENE simulations of the resulting heat loads: it is found that either the peak value or the extent of the striations appear to be overestimated compared to IRTV measurements. Reasonable agreement can only be achieved for the smallest footprint for lower input power and lower cross-field transport, or for higher upstream density and radiative power losses.",

    "abstract": "We investigate plasma wake generation via Compton scattering from photon bursts, a non-ponderomotive process relevant when the photon wavelength is smaller than the interparticle distance but larger than the Compton wavelength. In this regime, electrons can reach relativistic velocities. We extend linear theory to the nonlinear regime, showing that plasma waves can reach the wave-breaking limit. Perfectly collimated drivers produce wakes propagating at the speed of light, allowing electron phase-locking (limited by driver depletion). Non-collimated drivers induce subluminal phase velocities, limiting acceleration via dephasing. Two-dimensional simulations reveal unique transverse fields compared to laser wakefields, with a DC magnetic field leading to consistent focusing. The work considers observational prospects in laboratory and astrophysical scenarios such as around highly luminous compact objects (e.g., pulsars, gamma-ray bursts) interacting with tenuous interstellar or intergalactic plasmas, where conditions favor Comptondominated wakefield acceleration.",

    "title": "Square matrix-based six-dimensional convergence map for nonlinear beam dynamics analysis",
    "abstract": "The square matrix-based convergence map (CM) method has proven effective in characterizing nonlinear dynamics in several 4-D dynamical systems. However, when time-dependent perturbations, such as crabbing kicks in colliders, are present, a comprehensive 6-D analysis becomes essential to accurately capture the coupling between transverse and longitudinal motions. In this work, we extend the CM method to the full 6-D phase space by employing an eigen-decomposition-based formulation of the square matrix combined with iterative procedures. The proposed 6-D CM approach is first validated using a simplified crabbing map. We demonstrate that the 6-D CM preserves computational efficiency by using only one-turn map, while successfully resolving high-order resonance structures that remain unresolved by conventional frequency map analysis (FMA). This method is subsequently applied to the dynamic aperture (DA) study of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The results obtained from the CM analysis exhibit close agreement with those derived from FMA, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for nonlinear beam dynamics analysis and DA evaluation, as well as for broader applications in other nonlinear dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "The robust diagnosis of thermodynamic conditions in warm dense matter experiments remains a central challenge. We report angle-resolved femtosecond x-ray Thomson scattering measurements of shock-compressed aluminum at approximately 50 GPa over a wide range of scattering wavevectors at the European XFEL. The measured plasmon dispersion and line shape demonstrate that the standard analysis of x-ray Thomson scattering spectra based on uniform electron gas models systematically overestimates the plasmon resonance energy by up to 8 eV. In contrast, an analysis based on ab initio calculations reproduces both the dispersion and spectral shape within experimental uncertainty. Our results show that shock-induced disorder plays a critical role in the interpretation of x-ray Thomson scattering from compressed solids and provide direct evidence that ab initio approaches are required for reliable inference of thermodynamic conditions in warm dense aluminum.",

    "abstract": "We report numerical results regarding the minimum sustaining coil excitation current for a RF-RF hybrid torch operating at two different frequencies. The first coil is excited at a high-frequency, while the second coil is set at a medium frequency. The filling gas is argon, at atmospheric pressure. We use the modeling software COMSOL Multiphysics to describe the evolution of key parameters when: (i) the distance between the two coils changes, (ii) the power of the high frequency coil changes. We discuss the radial temperature profiles, the axial velocities and the heat convected at the end of the medium-frequency coil. The latter is compared with the total heat conduction to the plasma confinement tube wall.",

    "title": "Analysis of wave processes using beam-driven Langmuir/$\\mathcal{Z}$-mode waveforms generated in Particle-In-Cell simulations",
    "abstract": "During Type III solar radio bursts, beam-driven upper-hybrid wave turbulence is converted into electromagnetic emissions at the fundamental plasma frequency and its harmonic, through a chain of various linear and nonlinear wave processes. In this work, we mainly investigate the relative roles and interplay of two key mechanisms: the nonlinear decay of Langmuir/$\\mathcal Z$-mode waves and their linear transformations on random density fluctuations and, in particular, their mode conversion at constant frequency into electromagnetic waves. Using two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations, we employ a diagnostic approach based on large ensembles of virtual satellites that record local waveforms, enabling detailed temporal and spatial characterization of wave processes in randomly inhomogeneous plasmas. This method allows robust statistical analysis and direct comparison with spacecraft observations. The study focuses on the dependence of wave dynamics on the average level of density fluctuations and the plasma magnetization. Our results quantify the occurrence rate of decay under varying physical conditions and demonstrate how developed plasma density turbulence can significantly alter the balance between nonlinear wave-wave interactions and linear wave transformations. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for electromagnetic emissions during type III radio bursts and strengthen the connection between numerical simulations and in situ solar wind measurements, offering a valuable framework for the interpretation of future space-based waveform observations.",

Using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and RF-compensated Langmuir probe diagnostics, we measured ion temperature T i and drift velocity v z in argon plasmas near an immersed electrode. The multicusp configuration enhances plasma density at low pressure, enabling stable operation down to 0.8 mTorr. Timeaveraged measurements show no detectable perturbation near the pulsed electrode, indicating full plasma recovery between high-voltage pulses. LIF-derived potential profiles match Riemann's presheath theory, and ion velocity distributions reveal acceleration consistent with sheath dynamics. These results support the use of LIF for steady-state characterisation of the bulk and presheath regions in PIII systems.",

    "abstract": "The paper reports on the timing resolution obtained with the Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors for extreme fluences at the DESY Test Beam Facility with 4 GeV/c electrons. The LGADs adopt an $n$-in-$p$ technology with a $p^{+}$-type boron gain implant, co-implanted with carbon to mitigate acceptor deactivation. The substrate thickness of the sensors varies from 20 $μ$m to 45 $μ$m, with an active area spanning from 0.75 $\\times$ 0.75 to 1.28 $\\times$ 1.28 mm$^{2}$. A set of 30 $μ$m sensors irradiated with neutrons at fluences between 4 $\\times$ 10$^{14}$ and 2.5 $\\times$ 10$^{15}$ n$_{\\textrm{1 MeV eq.}}$cm$^{-2}$ were tested on the beam. The gain was measured between 7 and 40 across all non-irradiated sensors in the study, and between 7 and 30 in irradiated sensors. The experimental setup consisted of a 45 $μ$m-thick trigger sensor with an active area of 3.6 $\\times$ 3.6 mm$^{2}$, four device-under-test (DUT) planes, and a Photonis micro-channel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP) as a time reference. The timing resolution was calculated from Gaussian fitting of the difference in times of arrival of a particle at a DUT and the MCP, using the constant fraction discrimination technique. A timing resolution of 26.4 ps was achieved in 45 $μ$m sensors, and down to 16.6 ps in 20 $μ$m sensors. The combination of two 20 $μ$m LGAD sensors reached a timing resolution of 12.2 ps. A timing resolution of below 20 ps was obtained in all irradiated 30 $μ$m sensors.",

We explore the use of deep reinforcement learning for autonomous locking of Fabry-Perot optical cavities in non-linear regimes, with relevance to gravitational-wave detectors. A custom Gymnasium environment with a time-domain simulator enabled training of agents such as deep deterministic policy gradient, achieving reliable lock acquisition for both low- and high-finesse cavities, including Virgo-like parameters. We also discuss possible improvements with Twin Delayed DDPG, Soft Actor Critic and meta-reinforcement learning, as well as strategies for low-latency execution and off-line policy updates to address hardware limitations. These studies lay the groundwork for future deployment of reinforcement learning-based control in real optical setups.",

    "title": "Towards replacing detector simulation with heterogeneous GNNs in flavour physics analyses",
    "abstract": "Driven by the increasing volume of recorded data, the demand for simulation from experiments based at the Large Hadron Collider will rise sharply in the coming years. Addressing this demand solely with existing computationally intensive workflows is not feasible. This paper introduces a new fast simulation tool designed to address this demand at the LHCb experiment. This tool emulates the detector response to arbitrary multibody decay topologies at LHCb. Rather than memorising specific decay channels, the model learns generalisable patterns within the response, allowing it to interpolate to channels not present in the training data. Novel heterogeneous graph neural network architectures are employed that are designed to embed the physical characteristics of the task directly into the network structure. We demonstrate the performance of the tool across a range of decay topologies, showing the networks can correctly model the relationships between complex variables. The architectures and methods presented are generic and could readily be adapted to emulate workflows at other simulation-intensive particle physics experiments.",

    "abstract": "A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.",

    "title": "The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection",
    "abstract": "The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($η~\\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the \"frozen-in\" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.",

This paper presents a pedagogical experiment to visualize and quantitatively verify the conservation of the magnetic moment ($μ$) and the longitudinal invariant ($J$) using a standard educational electron charge-to-mass ratio apparatus configured as a magnetic bottle. By analyzing long-exposure photographs of the electron beam trajectory, we reconstructed the helical motion and calculated the invariants under different magnetic field configurations. Our results verify the conservation of the longitudinal invariant ($J$) with a ratio of 0.98 between configurations. The magnetic moment ($μ$) exhibited a coefficient of variation of approximately 7\\%, a deviation consistent with the presence of collisional effects in the tube. These findings demonstrate that complex plasma dynamics can be effectively studied using accessible laboratory equipment, providing a valuable bridge between theory and experiment for physics students.",

    "abstract": "Accurate monitoring of temperature, axial strain, and refractive index is critical for structural health monitoring, industrial process control, and environmental sensing. However, conventional optical fiber sensors are often limited by strong parameter cross sensitivity, poor discrimination capability, and increased system complexity when multiple sensing units are required. In this work, a compact multi-parameter optical fiber sensing platform is proposed based on a cascaded single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, and long-period fiber grating structure, combined with a wavelength-based spectral demodulation strategy. Within the cascaded configuration, multiple characteristic spectral troughs arising from distinct physical mechanisms coexist in a single transmission spectrum. Interference-induced troughs are generated by the multimode fiber section, while a resonance-induced trough is introduced by the long-period fiber grating. Although none of these troughs responds exclusively to a single parameter, each exhibits simultaneous and linearly independent responses to temperature, axial strain, and refractive index with distinct sensitivity magnitudes and trends. Consequently, each trough can be described by a unique sensitivity vector, enabling robust multi-parameter discrimination through multi-wavelength spectral demodulation.",

    "abstract": "Rare-event searches including dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$ν$NS), and neutrinoless double-beta decay (0$νββ$) require high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors with ultralow noise, stable backgrounds, and electrode geometries that can scale to larger single-crystal masses. Ring-contact (ring-and-groove) designs address scalability by shaping the electric field to preserve low-capacitance readout, but their nonplanar topology motivates a lithium-contact process that is compatible with conformal deposition and robust high-voltage operation. As a process demonstration toward future ring-contact prototypes, we fabricate and characterize a hybrid-contact planar HPGe device, KL01. Here, ``hybrid'' denotes an $n^{+}$ contact formed by an in-house lithium-suspension paint followed by controlled thermal diffusion, combined with an AJA-developed a-Ge/Al $p^{+}$ contact and a-Ge sidewall passivation. At 77~K the device exhibits pA-scale leakage current under kV bias, a depletion plateau near $V_{\\mathrm{dep}}\\approx 1300$~V, and energy resolutions of 1.57~keV FWHM at 59.5~keV and 2.57~keV FWHM at 662~keV. These results validate the compatibility of the paint-and-diffuse lithium process with thin-film a-Ge/Al contacts and establish a practical fabrication workflow to be extended to ring-and-groove electrodes for next-generation rare-event HPGe modules.",

    "title": "Towards a Self-Driving Trigger at the LHC: Adaptive Response in Real Time",
    "abstract": "Real-time data filtering and selection -- or trigger -- systems at high-throughput scientific facilities such as the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) must process extremely high-rate data streams under stringent bandwidth, latency, and storage constraints. Yet these systems are typically designed as static, hand-tuned menus of selection criteria grounded in prior knowledge and simulation. In this work, we further explore the concept of a self-driving trigger, an autonomous data-filtering framework that reallocates resources and adjusts thresholds dynamically in real-time to optimize signal efficiency, rate stability, and computational cost as instrumentation and environmental conditions evolve. We introduce a benchmark ecosystem to emulate realistic collider scenarios and demonstrate real-time optimization of a menu including canonical energy sum triggers as well as modern anomaly-detection algorithms that target non-standard event topologies using machine learning. Using simulated data streams and publicly available collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, we demonstrate the capability to dynamically and automatically optimize trigger performance under specific cost objectives without manual retuning. Our adaptive strategy shifts trigger design from static menus with heuristic tuning to intelligent, automated, data-driven control, unlocking greater flexibility and discovery potential in future high-energy physics analyses.",

    "title": "Forbidden second harmonics in centrosymmetric bilayer crystals",
    "abstract": "Optical spectroscopy based on second-order nonlinearity is a critical technique for characterizing two-dimensional (2D) crystals as well as bioimaging and quantum optics. It is generally believed that second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric crystals, such as graphene and other bilayer 2D crystals, is negligible without externally breaking the inversion symmetry. Here, we show that with a new homodyne detection technique, we can apparently circumvent this symmetry-imposed constraint and observe robust SHG in pristine centrosymmetric crystals, without any symmetry-breaking field. With its exceptional sensitivity, we resolve polarization-resolved SHG in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), bilayer 2H-WSe$_2$, and remarkably, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, allowing us to unambiguously identify the crystallographic orientation in these crystals via SHG for the first time. We also demonstrate that the new technique can be used to non-invasively detect uniaxial strain and optical geometric phase in these crystals. The observed SHG in our experiments is attributed to second-order nonlinearity in the quadrupole channel, which is controlled by the presence of the $C_2$ symmetry instead of the inversion symmetry. Our new technique expands the capability of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to encompass a large class of centrosymmetric materials that could never be measured before, and can be used for quantum sensing of moiré materials and twisted epitaxial films.",

    "abstract": "This article presents an evaluation of off-the-shelf commercial accelerometers at the mixing chamber stage of a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator at temperatures down to 8 mK. In addition, we present results of radioassay of accelerometer samples using a high purity germanium detector counting setup. Cryogen-free dilution refrigerators using pulse-tube cryocoolers (PTs)-due to recent advances in their cooling capacity, long-term stability, and operational costs-have become ubiquitous tools in a wide range of fields ranging from experimental particle physics to quantum information sciences. However, vibrations induced by PTs can negatively impact the experimental payload in these applications. This work demonstrates that commercially available accelerometers can not only measure vibrations at millikelvin cryogenic temperatures but also pave the way for continuous, in situ, real-time vibration monitoring of dry dilution refrigerators.",

    "title": "Role of Shafranov shift, zonal structures on the behavior of TAEs, AAEs and microinstabilities in the presence of energetic particles",
    "abstract": "In future nuclear fusion reactors, even a small fraction of fusion-born energetic particles (EP) about 100 times hotter than the thermal bulk species, contributes substantially to the kinetic pressure and therefore affect the MHD equilibrium, mainly via the Shafranov shift. In this work, we perform first-principles numerical simulations using the gyrokinetic, electromagnetic, global code ORB5 to study the effect of a self-consistent finite $β$ equilibrium on the arising Alfvén Eigenmodes (destabilized by EPs), Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG), and Kinetic Ballooning Modes (KBM) microturbulence (destabilized by thermal species). Linearly, we explore the complex interplay between EP fraction, bulk gradients and a self-consistent Shafranov shift on the plasma stability. We choose single toroidal mode numbers to represent the system's instabilities and study the characteristic nonlinear evolutions of TAEs, KBMs and ITGs separately and including the axisymmetric field response to each mode separately. This study focuses on the impact of Shafranov shift equilibrium consistency, as well as the self-generated zonal ${E \\times B}$ flows, the saturation levels and resulting heat and particle fluxes. In the ITG cases including the $n=0$ perturbations reduces turbulent fluxes, as expected, however, for the TAE cases including the $n=0$ perturbations is shown to enhance the fluxes. We show for the first time that Axisymmetric Alfvén Eigenmodes (AAEs) play a role in this mechanism.",

    "title": "Conservative velocity mappings for discontinuous Galerkin kinetics",
    "abstract": "Continuum computational kinetic plasma models evolve the distribution function of a plasma species $f_s$ on a phase-space grid over time. In many problems of interest the distribution function has limited extent in velocity space; hence, using a uniform, highly refined mesh would be costly and slow. Nonuniform velocity grids can reduce the computational cost by placing more degrees of freedom where $f_s$ is appreciable and fewer where it is not. In this work we introduce a first-of-its kind discontinuous Galerkin approach to nonuniform velocity-space discretization using mapped velocity coordinates. This new method is presented in the context of a gyrokinetic model used to study magnetized plasmas. We create discretizations of collisionless and collisional terms using mappings in a way that exactly conserves particles and energy. Numerical tests of such properties are presented, and we show that this new discretization can reproduce earlier gyrokinetic simulations using grids with up to 6-60 times fewer cells and 22X-60X speed-ups depending on dimensionality, geometry and plasma parameters.",

    "abstract": "Virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) spectrometers provide high resolution and fast acquisition in a compact design, but their performance as dispersive instruments is sensitive to fabrication tolerances, component dimensions, and alignment. Here, leveraging numerical simulations validated by experimental data, we present a framework to identify the parameters that limit VIPA spectrometer resolution. This framework is applied to the construction of a new mid infrared VIPA spectrometer, tested at wavelengths near 4.6 um with both continuous-wave and frequency-comb laser sources, with a resolving power predicted by analytical expressions to be as high as RP = 830 000 (corresponding to a resolution of 78 MHz). Validated numerical simulations, however, provided a more realistic estimate that captures limits set by all the optical components. By correcting aberrations and optimizing alignment, a resolving power of RP = 440 000 (150 MHz) was experimentally achieved, corresponding to 80% of the value predicted by numerical simulation of the entire spectrometer. These results bridge the gap between analytical design expressions and experimental results for compact, high-resolution VIPA spectrometers to enable more efficient fabrication and advanced design across critical areas like applied space optics, line-by-line pulse shaping, and broadband spectral sensors.",

A diamond superlattice was grown with a periodical varying boron doping profile. Four sinusoidally deformed (110) planes resulted with a period length of 5.0 $μ$m and an amplitude of 0.098 nm. A channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI A accelerator facility. A clear peak was detected with a large sodium iodide scintillation detector close to the expected photon energy of 1.28 MeV. Key characteristics of the peak, including photon energy, width and intensity, were reproduced fairly well by Monte-Carlo simulation calculations. Based on the latter, optimized boron doping profiles were designed for the 1.6 GeV beam of MAMI C and a hypothetical 3 GeV beam, enabling preparation of highly directional $γ$-ray beams with photon energies of 4.2 and 14.5 MeV. The predicted spectral bandwidths are, respectively, about 18\\% and 13\\%, however, with a high energy continuum tail. The on-target photon flux at a beam current of 100 $μ$A would be about $10^{12}$/s for the 14.5 MeV photon beam.",

    "abstract": "Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in light dark matter searches and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments as they can achieve low energy thresholds. The phonon mediated sensing of silicon particle absorbers has already been proved with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), acting both as sensors and athermal phonon absorbers at the same time. In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.",

It is also equipped with numerous cryogenic components, including control valves, flow meters, and safety valves, enabling experimental operation to be carried out directly by the ACPS itself and thereby reducing the cryogenic requirements imposed on the experiments. To support a wide range of experiments, the ACPS provides three transfer lines that deliver different levels of cooling power.",

    "title": "High-power beyond extreme ultraviolet FEL radiation with flexible polarization at SHINE",
    "abstract": "Linac-based free-electron lasers (FELs) feature high brightness, narrow bandwidth, controllable polarization, and wide wavelength tunability. With the rapid development of superconducting radio-frequency technology, linacs can now operate at MHz-level repetition rates, enabling FELs with both high repetition rates and high average power. Beyond extreme ultraviolet (BEUV) radiation is of great interest for scientific research and industrial applications, especially for next-generation lithography. Owing to the main design parameters of SHINE, the generation of BEUV radiation is a natural capability of the facility. The BEUV characteristics at SHINE are investigated and its achievable performance as a high-average-power light source is evaluated. By applying undulator tapering to enhance the energy extraction efficiency, kilowatt-level BEUV radiation with controllable polarization is shown to be achievable. These results demonstrate that SHINE can provide a high-performance BEUV source, offering a realistic pathway toward a high-average-power light source for next-generation high-resolution lithography.",

    "title": "Near-axis quasi-isodynamic database",
    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the landscape of quasi-isodynamic stellarators using the near-axis expansion of the magnetic field. Building on recent theoretical developments, we construct a database of more than 800,000 stable, approximately quasi-isodynamic vacuum magnetic configurations. These configurations span a range of field period numbers and other geometric control parameters, including the magnetic axis shape and plasma elongation. To evaluate each configuration, we use a broad set of measures, including effective ripple, sensitivity of the Shafranov shift to changes in plasma beta, the prevalence of maximum-J trapped particles, and the Rosenbluth-Hinton residual, among others. This enables an exhaustive, thorough and quantitative characterization of the database. Statistical analysis and modern machine learning techniques are then employed to find correlations, and identify key descriptors and heuristics to help understand tendencies that govern the behaviour of numerical optimization. The database provides baseline configurations for further studies, and to serve as tailored initial conditions for optimization. With this work we initiate a long term program to complete a systematic exploration of quasi-isodynamic stellarator design space.",

    "title": "Electric field-driven Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability in binary complex plasma",
    "abstract": "This study uses two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations to explore Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma, when heavier dust particles are positioned above the lighter ones, having the same charge-to-mass ratio, in a planar configuration. Langevin dynamics simulations are used to study the evolution of perturbations at the interface between these two distinct species of charged dust particles, subject to an externally applied electric field and an equilibrium charge density gradient. We have performed analytical calculations to determine the growth rate of instability under both strongly coupled and weakly coupled dusty plasma regimes. These theoretical predictions are subsequently validated through molecular dynamics simulations, enabling the reproduction of the instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma. The instability in these cases ultimately causes mixing among the charged species. The study comprehensively analyzes the growth rate as a function of various system parameters, and it offers deeper insight into the underlying physical mechanisms.",
