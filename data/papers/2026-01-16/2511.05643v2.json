  "title": "Transmission Efficiency of the Recoil Mass Spectrometer EMMA at TRIUMF",
  "abstract": "The mean transmission efficiency of the EMMA recoil mass spectrometer at TRIUMF has been measured with 6 different angular apertures at 17 kinetic energy/charge deviations with respect to the central, reference trajectory. Measurements performed using a 148Gd alpha source installed at the target position of the spectrometer are compared to ion-optical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The transmission efficiency as a function of angle and kinetic energy/charge is described empirically using piecewise Gaussian functions whose parameters are fit to the data.",
