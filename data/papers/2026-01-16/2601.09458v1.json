  "title": "Breakeven in Nuclear Fusion via Electron-Free Target",
  "abstract": "Nuclear fusion promises a nearly limitless energy source, but achieving breakeven-where fusion output exceeds input-requires extreme plasma conditions and complex confinement systems. Here we propose an alternative approach based on beam-target interactions, introducing a simple energy-based criterion that compares fusion energy generation with energy loss. By creating electron-free targets, stopping power is drastically reduced, enabling conditions where fusion energy surpasses beam energy deposition under practical scenarios. This approach offers a viable alternative pathway to fusion energy without high-temperature plasma confinement and warrants further experimental investigation.",
