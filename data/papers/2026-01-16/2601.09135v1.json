  "title": "Transient fields in oblique scattering from an infinite planar dielectric interface -- a qubit lattice simulation",
  "abstract": "An initial value algorithm is utilized to examine the time dependent evolution of the electromagnetic fields arising from oblique scattering of bounded pulses from an infinite planar dielectric interface. Since the qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) is almost fully unitary, one finds excellent conservation of electromagnetic energy. Various Gaussian envelope pulses are considered in regimes where the incident angle is below that needed for total internal reflection. While the reflected pulse retains its overall Gaussian shape, the transmitted pulse exhibits a combination of a Gaussian envelope along with Huygen-like emitted wave fronts from the collision point of the initial pulse with the infinite dielectric interface. The strength of these Huygen wavefronts depends on the width of the incident pulse.",
