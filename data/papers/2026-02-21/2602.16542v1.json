  "title": "Laboratory observation of collective beam-plasma instabilities in a relativistic pair jet",
  "abstract": "We report on a measurement of collective behavior in a relativistic electron-positron pair plasma produced in the laboratory. Using the Fireball platform at CERN's HiRadMat facility, 440 GeV protons were used to generate an ultra-relativistic, charge-neutral electron-positron pair beam that propagated through an ambient RF discharge plasma. Magnetic-field amplification due to a beam-plasma instability was diagnosed using a high-sensitivity Faraday-rotation probe, supported by detailed characterization of the diagnostic impulse response. The measured path-integrated magnetic field agrees quantitatively with predictions from particle-in-cell simulations. The results provide a critical benchmark for models of relativistic beam-plasma interactions in astrophysical contexts such as blazar jets and pulsar-wind nebulae.",
