  "title": "High-Voltage Performance Testing in LAr of the PMMA Cathode Connection for the DarkSide-20k Experiment",
  "abstract": "DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) is a next-generation dual-phase liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC) devoted to the direct-detection of dark matter. The detector is currently under construction in Hall-C at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of approximately 3500 m water equivalent. The detector will instrument 49.7 t of low-radioactivity underground LAr contained within an acrylic TPC and is designed to reach a WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section sensitivity down to $10^{-48}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $0.1\\,\\mathrm{TeV}/c^{2}$ in a 200 tonne-year run. In DS-20k a uniform electric drift field is established in the active volume to transport ionization electrons toward the electroluminescence region, with the required high voltage delivered to the TPC cathode through a custom cable and stress-cone assembly. At the University of California, Davis, a dedicated test setup was developed to reproduce the DS-20k cathode high-voltage connection in LAr, matching the local electric-field conditions. This work summarizes the results of a comprehensive test campaign validating the operation of the DS-20k cathode HV system in LAr up to $-100$ kV.",
