  "title": "Broadband Optical Modulation and Control at Millikelvin Temperatures",
  "abstract": "A universal experimental challenge when studying radiation effects on cryogenic devices is to precisely and accurately characterize the position-dependent device response very near the energy detection threshold. We have developed a compact cryogenic optical beam steering system that can be used to generate O(μs) pulses of small numbers of photons over the energy range of 1.2 - 4.5eV at room temperature, and deliver those photons via fiber optic to any specified location on the surface of a detector operating at cryogenic temperatures. This new system will allow for robust calibration of any photon-sensitive detector, including supercondcting devices. The system can be used efficiently to explore the physics of target materials, quantify the position sensitivity of different sensor designs, measure phonon transport, and study the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on detector operation. We describe the design of this pulsed calibration method and present first results obtained with a second-generation system operated at room temperature and sub-Kelvin temperatures.",
