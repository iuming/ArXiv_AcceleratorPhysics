  "title": "A Fully Spin and Polarization Resolved Strong Field QED Algorithm for Particle-in-Cell Codes",
  "abstract": "Modern ultra-intense laser facilities can generate electromagnetic fields strong enough to accelerate particles to near-light speeds over micron-scale distances and also approach the QED critical field, resulting in highly nonlinear and relativistic quantum phenomena. For such conditions, ab-initio modeling techniques are required that capture the electromagnetic, relativistic particle, and quantum emission processes in the plasma. One such technique is particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. In this paper, we describe the underlying theory for and development, validation, and verification of an extension to standard QED-PIC in the OSIRIS framework to include spin- and polarization-resolved QED processes central to next-generation laser-plasma experiments. This code can advance the current understanding of spin- and polarization-dependent QED phenomena in ultra-intense laser-plasma interactions.",
