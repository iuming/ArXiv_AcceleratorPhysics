  "title": "Optimization of the characteristics of a relativistic electron beam based on laser wake-field acceleration using a non-symmetric gas target profile",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate a high-energy, high-charge, electron source produced by the irradiation of a novel gaseous target by an ultra-intense femtosecond laser pulse. By exploiting a nonsymmetrical nozzle, we increased the total charge of the electron beam by at least an order of magnitude with respect to our previous experiments using symmetrical nozzles. In addition, the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons was enhanced by a factor of two. The electrons are accelerated via the Laser Wake-Field Acceleration mechanism. Particle-in-cell simulations indicate that electrons are injected via the ionization and the downramp injection mechanisms. Our measurements indicate that the demonstrated electron source is a considerable candidate for high dose, Very High Energy Electrons applications, such as radiotherapy.",
