  "title": "Calibration of an Irradiated Prototype for the EIC Zero-Degree Calorimeter",
  "abstract": "We study the response of a prototype Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detector to irradiation equivalent to 10$^{11}$ 1-MeV protons/cm$^2$, which matches the expected exposure after one year of operation at full nominal luminosity at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The prototype consists of 563 channels and represents about 10 percent of the final ZDC design in terms of both channel count and detector volume. It was irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with a dose equivalent to 10$^{11}$ protons/cm$^2$. We demonstrate that, despite significant radiation damage to the SiPMs and non-uniform degradation across the detector volume, the detector can be successfully calibrated on a channel-by-channel basis using cosmic-ray data. The damage profile, similar to what is expected in the experiment, varies by an order of magnitude or more across the detector. Even for the most heavily damaged channels, the signal-to-noise ratio for a MIP signal remains above 5. This study provides a realistic test of the system's performance under irradiation. It complements previous SiPM-specific irradiation studies and will inform the future operation of the ZDC and other detectors that use SiPM-on-tile technology.",
