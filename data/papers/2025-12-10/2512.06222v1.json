  "title": "3D PIC Simulations on Hall Thruster Electron Drift Instability: Influence of Magnetic Field on Electron Transport",
  "abstract": "Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are employed to investigate electron transport characteristics in Hall thrusters, with particular focus on how magnetic field configuration affects the electron transport due to electron drift instabilities. Comparing analytic and realistic magnetic field models reveals significant differences in electron transport patterns, where radial variations in field strength lead to asymmetric transport enhanced in low-field regions. The derived effective electron mobility shows agreement with direct simulation diagnoses, and the obtained two-dimensional transport profiles provide a foundation for developing more accurate reduced-dimensional models.",
