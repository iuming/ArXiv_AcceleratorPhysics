  "title": "A Method for Solving Linearized Vlasov Equation for Low-Frequency Long-Wavelength Electromagnetic Modes in Inhomogeneous Plasmas",
  "abstract": "A method for solving linearized Vlasov equation for low-frequency, long-wavelength electromagnetic modes in magnetically confined inhomogeneous plasmas is described. The relevant non-local solution that includes the lowest-significant-order effects of inhomogeneities is obtained from the solutions of three simple equations by means of elementary algebra. The method appears to be more convenient than the commonly used method of integration along the unperturbed particle orbits and should be of interest to students of theoretical plasma physics.",
