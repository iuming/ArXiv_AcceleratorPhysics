    "title": "Commissioning of an experiment for thermodynamic and spectroscopic studies of hydrogen isotopologues at cryogenic conditions",
    "abstract": "To study thermodynamic properties and dynamic phase space behavior of hydrogen isotopologues (Q$_2$) at cryogenic temperatures and at high density, the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy 2 (T$_2$ApIR) experiment has been set up and commissioned at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). In the frame of the experiment, Q$_2$ behavior in different phases, ortho/para states, temperatures (10 K - 300 K) and pressures (up to 2.5 bar a) will be investigated with optical methods, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The facility consists of a fully tritium compatible cryostat, which includes an optical cell, ortho/para converter and windows for optical and spectroscopic studies. The cryostat can be cooled below the H$_2$ triple point by a two-stage cryocooler and contains openings in the cryogenic shielding for the optical access. The challenge of combining these scientific requirements in a design with high amounts of tritium (14 g), in a limited space, all while maintaining the TLK safety philosophy was solved by the presented design. The experiment is ready to be fully integrated into the TLK closed loop tritium infrastructure. This contribution reports a comprehensive overview of the commissioning phase of the experimental facility and the results of the first commissioning experiments, including cryogenic performance tests, commissioning experiments with non-radioactive gases, and tests of the analytical instruments.",

    "title": "The new truly cylindrical tracker for the ALICE ITS3",
    "abstract": "The ALICE collaboration is preparing an upgrade of the three innermost layers of the current Inner Tracking System (ITS) during the next LHC long shutdown (LS3). The new ITS detector will use wafer-scale (up to \\SI{27}{cm} in length) Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors with a \\SI{65}{nm} CMOS Image Sensor process, thinned to \\SI{50}{\\micro m} and bent around the beam pipe. The planned upgrade will allow the use of only two sensors per tracker layer, kept in place by just two mechanical supports at the edges and two thin carbon fibre supports at the sensor border. The substitution of water cooling with air cooling will lead to an expected reduction of the material budget per-layer from $\\sim$0.36\\% $X_0$ of the current detector to 0.09\\% $X_0$. The R\\&D process also led to the development of a new sensor variant with an additional low dose n-type implant to the previous detector. This improves charge collection speed, confirms a spatial resolution of about \\SI{5}{\\micro m}, a detection efficiency greater than 99\\% and an excellent radiation tolerance. Large area prototypes proved the possibility to have an active area greater than 90\\%, and a fake hit rate lower than \\SI{e-6}{hits/pixel/event} without loosing detection efficiency. This proceeding will show the above innovations, with particular attention to a small area analogue test structure featuring a front-end which can be monitored via an on-chip Operational Amplifier buffer that preserves the steep signal edge (few hundreds of ps) in order to study the sensor timing performance. The characterization proved a time resolution of \\SI{63}{ps} on average and \\SI{50}{ps} for signal passing right under the electrode with a detection efficiency above 99\\%.",

    "title": "A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book",
    "abstract": "A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.   I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.",

    "title": "Pulse Shape Discrimination for Germanium Detectors using Variational Quantum Circuits",
    "abstract": "Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is a critical component in background rejection for neutrinoless double-beta decay and dark matter searches using Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detectors. To date, advanced discrimination has relied on Deep Learning approaches employing e.g. Denoising Autoencoders (DAE) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While effective, these models require tens of thousands of parameters and heavy pre-processing. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to real, experimental pulse waveforms from a germanium detector. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid approach using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) with amplitude encoding. By mapping the 1024-sample waveforms directly into a 10-qubit Hilbert space, we demonstrate that a VQC with only 302 trainable parameters achieves a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 and a global accuracy of 97.1%. This result demonstrates that even in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum models can match the performance of state-of-the-art classical baselines while reducing model complexity by over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we envision a scenario where future quantum sensors transmit quantum states directly to such processing units, exploiting the exponentially large Hilbert space in a natively quantum pipeline.",

    "title": "A journey to ITACA",
    "abstract": "A unique feature of gas xenon electroluminescent time projection chambers (GXeEL TPCs) in $0νββ$ searches is their ability to reconstruct event topology, in particular to distinguish \"single-electron\" from \"double-electron\" tracks, the latter being the signature of a $0νββ$ decay near the decay endpoint $Q_{ββ}$. Together with excellent energy resolution and the t$_0$ provided by primary scintillation, this topological information is key to suppressing backgrounds. Preserving EL, however, requires operating in pure xenon (with helium as the only benign additive), and in pure xenon the diffusion of drifting electrons is large. As a result, the fidelity of reconstructed tracks is limited both by diffusion and by the intrinsic blurring of EL amplification.   We propose augmenting the detector with the ability to image not only the electron track but also the corresponding mirror ion track. Introducing trace amounts of NH$_3$ ($\\sim$100 ppb) converts Xe$^+$ ions into NH$_4^+$ while leaving EL unaffected. For events in the region-of-interest, an ion sensor positioned near the cathode at the projected barycenter captures the NH$_4^+$ ions. Electrons drift rapidly to the anode, producing the standard EL image, whereas the NH$_4^+$ ions drift slowly toward the cathode. Their slow drift provides time to determine the event energy and barycenter. Laser interrogation of the sensor's molecular layer then reveals an ion-track image with sub-millimeter diffusion and no EL-induced smearing.   The combined electron-ion imaging substantially strengthens topological discrimination, improving background rejection by about an order of magnitude and significantly extending the discovery potential of GXeEL TPCs for very long $0νββ$ lifetimes.",

    "title": "Angular emission of scintillators for nuclear fusion diagnostics",
    "abstract": "Accurate characterization of fast-ion behavior is essential for the safe and efficient operation of nuclear fusion plasmas, as energetic particle losses can degrade plasma performance and damage reactor components. Scintillator-based detectors are widely employed to monitor fast ions; however, existing studies often assume isotropic light emission, neglecting potential angular dependencies that can compromise the determination of ion fluxes. In this work, we investigate the angular emission properties of two commercial scintillators, TG-Green and b-SiAlON, under irradiation with 3.5 MeV He++ and 1 MeV D+ beams, representative of conditions in future fusion devices such as ITER. A novel experimental setup, combining precise optical alignment, angular scanning, and rigorous calibration, was developed to measure the detection efficiency as a function of observation angle. Prior to the characterization, stability tests demonstrated negligible radiation-induced degradation under the applied fluences, and transmission losses due to optical fiber bending were found to be below 1.5%. The results reveal a pronounced angular anisotropy in scintillation emission for both materials, with intensity decreasing as the detection angle increases, well described by an empirical cosine-based model. Additionally, the normalized response shows minimal dependence on ion species or energy. These findings improve scintillator-based diagnostics, allowing more accurate measurement of fast-ion fluxes in fusion plasmas.",

    "title": "Optimised neural networks for online processing of ATLAS calorimeter data on FPGAs",
    "abstract": "A study of neural network architectures for the reconstruction of the energy deposited in the cells of the ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeters under high pile-up conditions expected at the HL-LHC is presented. These networks are designed to run on the FPGA-based readout hardware of the calorimeters under strict size and latency constraints. Several architectures, including Dense, Recurrent (RNN), and Convolutional (CNN) neural networks, are optimised using a Bayesian procedure that balances energy resolution against network size. The optimised Dense, CNN, and combined Dense+RNN architectures achieve a transverse energy resolution of approximately 80 MeV, outperforming both the optimal filtering (OF) method currently in use and RNNs of similar complexity. A detailed comparison across the full dynamic range shows that Dense, CNN, and Dense+RNN accurately reproduce the energy scale, while OF and RNNs underestimate the energy. Deep Evidential Regression is implemented within the Dense architecture to address the need for reliable per-event energy uncertainties. This approach provides predictive uncertainty estimates with minimal increase in network size. The predicted uncertainty is found to be consistent, on average, with the difference between the true deposited energy and the predicted energy.",

    "abstract": "We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions.   The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80\\%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics.   These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.",

    "title": "Single-step laser patterning and thinning of biocompatible MEMS flow sensor",
    "abstract": "Micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) thermal flow sensors are increasingly used for compact, low-power flow monitoring in biomedical applications. However, silicon-based method for sensor fabrication is limited by high cost, rigidity, and multi-step cleanroom processes. This study presents a single-step fiber laser micromachining method for fabricating biocompatible, free-standing MEMS thermal flow sensors from ultrathin titanium foil. The process combines patterning and localized thinning in single-step process, with titanium serving as resistive sensing element. A dual-matrix optimization approach consisting of a Threshold Mapping Matrix (TMM) and Energy Density Matrix (EDM) was used to determine optimized parameters without repeated trial-and-error. For localized thinning, sequential R-T scans with cooling intervals reduced redeposition from the Gaussian beam profile and produced uniform thickness reduction from 50 μm to 20--30 μm. The fabricated sensors were evaluated through thermal coefficient resistance (TCR) measurement, Infrared (IR) thermography, and airflow tests under steady and cyclic conditions controlled by artificial ventilation system. The fabricated devices showed a stable TCR of 3278 ppm °C$^{-1}$, a linear relationship calibration curve between velocity and resistance with $R^2$=0.986 and a 54% improvement in thermal response was achieved with the free-standing structure design compared to substrate-fixed designs. This fabrication approach removes the need for photolithography, wet/dry etching, and wafer bonding, enabling faster and lower-cost production of flexible, biocompatible flow sensors. The method can be applied to other MEMS devices that require compact size, flexibility, localized thinning and free-standing structures.",

    "title": "Collisional passing alpha energy transport in nearly quasisymmetric stellarators",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in stellarator optimization have found nearly precise quasisymmetric configurations. These are expected to reduce the non-turbulent background plasma transport to acceptable neoclassical levels while removing nearly all collisionless direct orbit losses of alpha particles. Yet, alpha particles under resonant conditions can be very sensitive to collisions, causing concerning energy losses and damaging plasma facing components. For the passing alphas such resonances can happen near rational surfaces in the presence of helical error field departures from quasisymmetry that change the magnetic field direction and magnitude. The cancellation between streaming motion and tangential drift of the alphas enhances the effective collision frequency, allowing the formation of a collisional boundary layer and giving rise to a perturbed distribution function. We develop an analytical model to illustrate and evaluate the resonant plateau transport this mechanism causes by formulating a drift kinetic treatment. The results indicate the associated energy losses can become significant in the vicinity of rational surfaces at values of q=m/n when error fields with poloidal and toroidal numbers m and n are present. In addition, we investigate the validity of the quasilinear approximation to the energy flux to show that it imposes a restriction on the error field amplitude that can be considered.",

Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model.

    "abstract": "All-electrical methods for nucleating, detecting, and manipulating spin textures in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets can serve as fundamental building blocks for multi-state spintronic memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing applications. Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.",

Built on experiments by one of us based on a simple parallel plate model for inertial sensor, in the present work a more sophisticated inertial sensor model that mimics the surface properties and work function of a cubical TM of an inertial sensor in space (like that of the LISA Pathfinder) is employed to study bipolar charge management system that utilizes UV-LEDs with peak wavelengths of 269 nm, 275 nm, 280 nm, and 295 nm that are longer than the standard 255 nm commonly employed for direct TM illumination. Experimental results indicate that the 275 nm UV-LED achieves optimal performance, maintaining the TM potential closer to zero and at the same time accommodates both rapid discharge and continuous discharge strategies. The present work provides useful input in the future study of system design and optimization for the charge management system.",

    "title": "GRANITE: Mechanical Characterization and Optical Inspection of Large-Area TPC Electrodes",
    "abstract": "Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.   We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\\,μ\\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\\,μ\\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\\,μ\\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\\,μ\\text{m}$.   Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.",

    "title": "Self-Error Correcting Method for Magnetic-Array-Type Current Sensors in Multi-Core Cable Applications",
    "abstract": "Data-driven methods enable online assessment of error states in magnetic-array-type current sensors, and long-term measurement stability can be enhanced through further self-error correction. However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as $2\\times10^{-3}$ in relative error and $2\\times10^{-3}$ rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor's error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method.",

    "abstract": "Real-time data processing of the next generation of experiments at FAIR requires reliable event reconstruction and thus depends heavily on in-situ calibration procedures. Previously, we developed a neural-network-based approach that predicts calibration parameters from continuously available environmental and operational data and validated it on the HADES Multiwire Drift Chambers (MDCs), achieving fast predictions as accurate as offline calibrations. In this work, we introduce several methodological improvements that enhance both accuracy and the ability to adapt to new data. These include changes to the input features, better offline calibration and trainable normalizations. Furthermore, by combining beam-time and cosmic-ray datasets, we demonstrate that the learned dependencies can be transferred between very different data-taking scenarios. This enables the network not only to provide real-time calibration predictions, but also to infer optimal high-voltage settings, thus establishing a practical framework for a real-time detector control during data acquisition process.",

    "abstract": "For the angular radiation patterns of proton, deuteron or alpha emission we present a way using particle-in-cell simulation of laser induced nanoplasmonic fusion. The differential Hanbury-Brown and Twiss analysis is widely used in astrophysics and in relativistic heavy ion physics to determine the source size of emitted particles. Here, we show how this method could be adopted for inertial confinement fusion. This method aims to determine the parameters of emitted nuclei after the fusion target ignition. In addition to spatial volume, the method can detect specific space-time correlation patterns connected to the collective flow post-ignition. In the NAPLIFE project our aim is to avoid thermalization and fluidization as much as possible at each stage of the fusion process. As the original laser beam is non-thermal and not equilibrated in any way it is obvious that we can minimize energy loss if we exploit the initial available energy in a non-thermal way. The detailed dynamics of deuterium and alpha production is not aimed at and not addressed by this paper.",

    "abstract": "A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.",

    "title": "The influence of Parker spiral on the reflection-driven turbulence",
    "abstract": "The solar wind is observed to undergo substantial heating as it expands through the heliosphere, with measured temperature profiles exceeding those expected from adiabatic cooling. A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfvén speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfvén waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it \"cuts across\" perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations.",

To meet these challenges, the CMS detector will undergo several upgrades, including the replacement of the current endcap calorimeters with a novel High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL). To make optimal use of this innovative detector, new and original algorithms are being devised. A dedicated reconstruction framework, The Iterative Clustering (TICL), is being developed within the CMS Software (CMSSW). This new framework is designed to fully exploit the high spatial resolution and precise timing information provided by HGCAL. Several key ingredients of the object reconstruction chain already rely on Machine Learning (ML) techniques and their usage is expected to further develop in the future. The existing reconstruction strategies will be presented stressing the role played by ML techniques to exploit the information provided by the detector. The areas where ML techniques are expected to play a role in the future developments will be also discussed.",

    "title": "Modified vacuum polarization in the presence of a plasma",
    "abstract": "We study vacuum polarization due to strong fields, in the presence of an electron-positron plasma. For this purpose, we expand quantum kinetic equations using weak fields and slow temporal scales as expansion parameters. It is demonstrated that the evolution of the Dirac field can be described by classical-like distribution functions for electrons and positrons, which are weakly coupled through quantum interactions. Furthermore, we deduce that these coupling terms give rise to well-known expressions for vacuum polarization, in addition to quantum modifications proportional to the content of real particles. Depending on the initial plasma density, the dominant quantum corrections to classical evolution may arise from real particle couplings or from the vacuum polarization associated with virtual particles. The implications of our results are discussed.",

    "title": "Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria",
    "abstract": "The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints. For a cubic temperature the equilibrium has an analytic solution which is investigated.",

    "title": "Optimization of gain uniformity in thermal bonding Micromegas for the PandaX-III experiment",
    "abstract": "Micro-pattern gas detectors (MPGDs) are widely utilized in physics experiments owing to their excellent spatial resolution and high-rate capabilities. Within the PandaX-III experiment, which aims to investigate neutrinoless double beta decay, Micromegas detectors serve as charge readout devices. High energy resolution is a critical requirement for the readout plane in this context, and gain uniformity significantly impacts the achievable resolution, primarily because of the extended tracks of primary ionization electrons. However, scaling up MPGDs to larger active areas exacerbates the challenge of maintaining gain uniformity, and effectively controlling the uniformity of the avalanche gap is a key factor in the detector manufacturing process via the thermal bonding method. This study demonstrates that optimizing the thermal bonding films specifically at the detector edges can effectively improve the gain uniformity, achieving a gain uniformity of < 5% over the entire 200*200 mm2 active area in a 1 bar Ar/isobutane (96.5/3.5) gas mixture. Additionally, the gain uniformity of approximately 14% was characterized at high pressures of up to 10 bar, revealing promising potential for high resolution measurements in the PandaX-III experiment and other high-pressure applications.",

Key innovations include a unified framework supporting product-bi-kappa, kappa-Maxwellian, bi-Maxwellian, and hybrid distributions with multi-component and loss-cone features; a concise rational-form eigenvalue formulation; and a 2--3 times reduction in matrix dimensions compared to the BO-KM solver, with improved efficiency at larger kappa indices. Benchmark tests confirm accurate reproduction of standard kinetic results and efficient resolution of waves and instabilities. BO-PBK thus provides a computationally efficient tool for wave and stability analysis in space and laboratory plasmas.",

    "title": "FGE: A Fast Free-Boundary Grad-Shafranov Evolutive Solver",
    "abstract": "Accurate and rapid simulation of the free boundary tokamak plasma equilibrium evolution is essential for modern plasma control, stability analysis, and scenario development. This paper presents the Free-Boundary Grad-Shafranov Evolutive (FGE) code, a highly flexible and control-oriented solver designed to address the challenges posed by advanced plasma configurations across a range of devices. FGE evolved from the FBT and LIUQE codes and is part of the MEQ suite, sharing many of the low-level optimized functions. It self-consistently solves the free-boundary Grad-Shafranov equation coupled with circuit equations for external conductors and models for plasma profile evolution. The code implements a fully non-linear, Newton-based framework with multiple, highly optimized solver options, state representations, and residual formulations that enable rapid computation across different simulation setups. A key capability is the self-consistent integration of various 0D and 1D current diffusion equations (CDEs) to model the resistive evolution of the plasma current profile as well as the ability to model plasmas with multiple magnetic axes (Doublets). Furthermore, FGE allows to linearize the plasma dynamics around a given equilibrium to generate a state-space model suitable for controller design and analysis. Numerical studies are presented demonstrating the code's speed of convergence and validating its performance against experimental data. Furthermore, benchmarks against the RAPTOR and KINX codes for profile evolution and vertical growth rate estimates are presented highlighting FGE's capabilities for both prediction and analysis.",

    "abstract": "We present a synchronization-free differential observable for one-way inter-satellite laser ranging, designed to suppress first-order Doppler effects without requiring clock synchronization between spacecraft. The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.",

    "abstract": "A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective direct timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron beam.   I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, for ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line corresponding to the duration of electron bunches or beams. The present article touches the topic of getting circle on resonance limit and the deflection sensitivity.",

Here, we present a methodology to use a collection of smartphones, namely a fleet, as a distributed network of time-synchronized mechanical sensors. We first present the mechanical tests we develop to evaluate the smartphone sensor accuracy. We then describe how to use efficiently a distributed network of smartphones as autonomous sensors. We use a combination of an Android application hosted on each phone (Gobannos), and a server application (Phonefleet) on a controlling host to perform the tasks in parallel remotely. We implement in particular a time synchronization protocol based on UDP communication. We achieved an accuracy of the smartphone clock synchronisation of 60 microseconds. Using two test cases in realistic outdoor conditions, we eventually prove the reliability of a smartphone fleet to measure mechanical wave measurements in field conditions.",

    "title": "Laser-written reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit directly coupled to a single-photon avalanche diode array",
    "abstract": "To date, most integrated quantum photonics experiments rely on single-photon detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures coupled to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) through single-mode optical fibers. This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed.",

    "abstract": "We report the observation of two nuclear recoil peaks induced by neutron capture on aluminum in a cryogenic Al$_2$O$_3$ detector developed by the NUCLEUS collaboration for the detection of reactor neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus (CEvNS) process. Data collected at the Technical University of Munich in 2024 with a $^{252}$Cf source reveal a main recoil line at 1145 eV from single-$γ$ de-excitation of $^{28}$Al and a newly observed structure near 575 eV originating from several two-$γ$ cascades. The latter constitutes the first direct measurement of a nuclear recoil line induced by multi-$γ$ cascades. It is predicted by our simulations when the recoiling nucleus has time to stop before the emission of the next $γ$-ray in the cascade. These results demonstrate the potential performance of the CRAB (Calibration Recoil for Accurate Bolometry) method for in situ nuclear recoil calibration and highlight the importance of accurately modeling recoil stopping and nuclear de-excitation times in cryogenic detectors of CEvNS and dark matter interactions.",

    "abstract": "Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.",

    "title": "Solitons in Quasi-Neutral non-Equilibrated Plasmas",
    "abstract": "In an experiment performed in November 2022 at the one-petawatt (PW) laser facility Vega III in Salamanca, Spain, we studied the production of several radioisotopes using the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) method (M. Rodrigues et al. [1], K. Batani et al. [12]). Using the experimental proton energy distribution recorded on a shot-by-shot basis and confirmed on average in a follow-up experiment, we derive the number of nuclear reactions on different targets for a single shot. From this single-shot analysis, we obtain an effective plasma temperature per shot from the yield ratio 11C/7Be. This gives strong limits to the yields of the reaction p + 11B -> 3 alpha, which may reach (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 as in 2pi. From the fluctuations of the proton spectra and the fusion yields, we derive the TNSA Equation of State (EOS). The deviation of this EOS from the classical ideal gas limit indicates that the plasma is non-neutral and well described by the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Solitons drive the system toward charge neutrality. We derive an effective soliton mass of ms = (26 +/- 1) meV and a soliton speed on the order of vs/c ~ 0.06. Understanding the soliton dynamics is crucial for applications and basic science.",

    "title": "Flexible BiSel/NiO-based X-ray synapses bridging the functions of detection and memory",
    "abstract": "Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are employed to investigate electron transport characteristics in Hall thrusters, with particular focus on how magnetic field configuration affects the electron transport due to electron drift instabilities. Comparing analytic and realistic magnetic field models reveals significant differences in electron transport patterns, where radial variations in field strength lead to asymmetric transport enhanced in low-field regions. The derived effective electron mobility shows agreement with direct simulation diagnoses, and the obtained two-dimensional transport profiles provide a foundation for developing more accurate reduced-dimensional models.",

    "abstract": "This work presents radiation-tolerant implementations for the SALSA front-end readout ASIC through redundancy methods applied to two median-finding algorithms designed for coherent noise suppression. Bit-wise Median Finder (BWMF) and Combinatorial Sum Median Finder (CSMF) were implemented in TSMC \\SI{65}{\\nano\\meter} and evaluated in terms of area, power, and latency. Three redundancy techniques were applied in this work to compare their impact: simple TMR, full TMR, and temporal TMR (TTMR). The simple and full TMR approach was applied in both algorithms to establish comparisons and TTMR was applied to CSMF as an improvement. The results indicate that the BWMF achieves efficient performance in terms of area and power under the simple TMR scheme, but exhibits significantly higher power consumption when using the more robust full TMR approach. The TTMR technique, in turn, offers reliable fault tolerance while maintaining a feasible balance between area and power.",

    "title": "Fast prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition",
    "abstract": "Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.",

    "abstract": "The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration is designing a new generation of low background, noble liquid bubble chamber experiments with sub-keV nuclear recoil threshold. These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture.",

    "title": "GPU acceleration of optical photon propagation in low photon yield applications: Opticks for the Electron Ion Collider",
    "abstract": "The bulk of time spent in the simulation of Cherenkov and other scintillation detectors is spent on optical-photon transport, i.e. ray tracing, a task that GPUs are uniquely qualified to perform. We present EIC-Opticks, a fork of Opticks, which uses event aggregation to drastically accelerate photon transport simulation for low-to-moderate photon yield experiments. During the full Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of a given detector, optical photon simulation is performed on GPU(s) using the NVIDIA OptiX framework. We validate this approach using the ePIC pfRICH detector. We find GPU and CPU simulations in excellent agreement. For $5\\times 10^4$ electrons with a momentum of $p=5~\\mathrm{MeV}/c$ in the test case of the pfRICH detector, EIC-Opticks shows an order-of-magnitude speedup over multi-threaded Geant4, and a factor of up to 161$\\pm$3 over single-threaded execution. In the case of low-to-moderate applications event aggregation reduces the per-photon simulation time from $\\sim60\\,μ\\mathrm{s}$ for single events to $\\sim20\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ with batching, a factor of $\\sim3000$. In order to make EIC-Opticks easily installable, we authored a Spack package that makes it possible to install it with a single command. Additionally, a Docker container is provided for users with EIC-Opticks installed. EIC-Opticks provides guardrails for common pitfalls (e.g. nested volume conversion, ray tracing setting optimization).",

    "abstract": "Magnetic shear across the polarity inversion line (PIL) plays an important role in the explosive nature of reconnection onset and in the equilibration of current sheets, acting as a source of free energy that can enhance or inhibit the onset process under certain conditions. In this study, we use a 2D PIC simulation to examine the local interaction between the reconnection guide field and thermodynamic variables during reconnection onset in a region of initially depleted thermal energy and enhanced magnetic energy in a large guide field background. We identify critical stages of the equilibration process, characterize intervals based on whether the pressure evolution is driven by changes in density or temperature, and discuss what these intervals imply about the evolution of local heat and work density. Finally, we examine power densities associated with electromagnetic field time evolution and electromagnetic energy transfer and compare to those related to thermodynamic changes.",

    "abstract": "We consider a pair of driver/witness electron bunches propagating in an ionized gas background a configuration similar to the one produced in a capillary discharge where a plasma oscillation has been excited by a driving pulse. We assume as in the plasma nonlinear regime that the plasma electrons behind the driver are completely expelled and an ellipsoidal cavity filled with ions only is formed. The fields are linear in both longitudinal and transverse directions, at least in the region of interest for particle acceleration, as the one produced by a uniform ion distribution within a uniformly charged ellipsoidal volume. The fields produced by the ions and experienced by a witness electron beam are purely electrostatic, being the ions at rest in the laboratory frame on the time scale of interest and it can be represented with the field distribution produced by a 3D charged ellipsoidal. The energy spread and emittance degradation has been studied by slicing the bunch in an array of cylinders and solving envelope equations for each bunch slice. The properties of transverse envelope and emittance oscillations and energy spread degradation have been analyzed together with the related matching conditions for optimal transport and acceleration.",

While the most advanced tools for calculating Stark profiles are computer simulation models (CSMs), their application to complex lineshapes under the extreme conditions of ICF experiments is computationally challenging. In this manuscript, we present results of several CSM realizations applied to the Stark shape of the krypton He-beta line and its satellites at ICF-relevant conditions (ne = 1e24 to 1e25 cm-3, Te = 3keV).
