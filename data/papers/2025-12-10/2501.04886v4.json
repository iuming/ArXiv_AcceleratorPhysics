  "title": "Distributed network of smartphone sensors: a new tool for scientific field measurements",
  "abstract": "Smartphones sensors are now commonly used by a worldwide audience thanks to their availability, high connectivity, and versatility. Here, we present a methodology to use a collection of smartphones, namely a fleet, as a distributed network of time-synchronized mechanical sensors. We first present the mechanical tests we develop to evaluate the smartphone sensor accuracy. We then describe how to use efficiently a distributed network of smartphones as autonomous sensors. We use a combination of an Android application hosted on each phone (Gobannos), and a server application (Phonefleet) on a controlling host to perform the tasks in parallel remotely. We implement in particular a time synchronization protocol based on UDP communication. We achieved an accuracy of the smartphone clock synchronisation of 60 microseconds. Using two test cases in realistic outdoor conditions, we eventually prove the reliability of a smartphone fleet to measure mechanical wave measurements in field conditions.",
