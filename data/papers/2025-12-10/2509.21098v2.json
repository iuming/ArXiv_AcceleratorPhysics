  "title": "First Electron Acceleration in a Tunable-Velocity Laser Wakefield",
  "abstract": "We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.",
