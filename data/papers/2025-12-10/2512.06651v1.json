  "title": "A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book",
  "abstract": "A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective direct timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron beam.   I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, for ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line corresponding to the duration of electron bunches or beams. The present article touches the topic of getting circle on resonance limit and the deflection sensitivity.",
