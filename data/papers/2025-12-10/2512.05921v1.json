  "title": "Thermodynamics of Shear Equilibration During Magnetic Reconnection Onset in Mixed-Equilibrium Current Sheets",
  "abstract": "Magnetic shear across the polarity inversion line (PIL) plays an important role in the explosive nature of reconnection onset and in the equilibration of current sheets, acting as a source of free energy that can enhance or inhibit the onset process under certain conditions. In this study, we use a 2D PIC simulation to examine the local interaction between the reconnection guide field and thermodynamic variables during reconnection onset in a region of initially depleted thermal energy and enhanced magnetic energy in a large guide field background. We identify critical stages of the equilibration process, characterize intervals based on whether the pressure evolution is driven by changes in density or temperature, and discuss what these intervals imply about the evolution of local heat and work density. Finally, we examine power densities associated with electromagnetic field time evolution and electromagnetic energy transfer and compare to those related to thermodynamic changes.",
