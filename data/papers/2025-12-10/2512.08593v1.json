  "title": "Study of a small-scale gamma-ray detection system employing Compton scattering with a monolithic CeBr3 crystal and segmented photodetector array",
  "abstract": "Study of high energy cosmic events in the MeV range requires detector with high efficiency and energy resolution to be constructed. The present setup consisting of scintillator crystals CeBr3 with different thickness, each coupled with 12 x 12 segmented SiPM-based photodetector in a multichannel system represents an initial exploration of a gamma imaging system based on Compton scattering principles. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the energy deposit and detection efficiency using the 137Cs gamma line. The study reveals a correlation between the relative distance between detector planes and the energy deposition efficiency, providing valuable insights into optimizing the telescope design.",
