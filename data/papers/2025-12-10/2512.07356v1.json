  "title": "Dispersive readout with two orthogonal modes of a dielectric cavity",
  "abstract": "Nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond have proven themselves as a good, sensitive element for the measurement of magnetic fields. While the mainstream of magnetometers based on NV centers uses so-called optically detected magnetic resonance, there has recently been a suggestion to use dispersive readout of a dielectric cavity to enhance the sensitivity of magnetometers. Here, we demonstrate that the dispersive readout approach can be significantly improved if a two-channel scheme is considered.",
