  "title": "Computer simulations of the Stark effect in the helium-beta complex of krypton in ICF conditions",
  "abstract": "There is an ongoing interest in using spectroscopy in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments, where dopants such as krypton can provide vital information about the temperature and density of the imploding plasma. While the most advanced tools for calculating Stark profiles are computer simulation models (CSMs), their application to complex lineshapes under the extreme conditions of ICF experiments is computationally challenging. In this manuscript, we present results of several CSM realizations applied to the Stark shape of the krypton He-beta line and its satellites at ICF-relevant conditions (ne = 1e24 to 1e25 cm-3, Te = 3keV). We demonstrate that codes with the same underlying physics but different numerical approaches yield identical results and analyze the differences in the line profile caused by various physical effects.",
