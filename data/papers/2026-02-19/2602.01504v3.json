  "title": "First Experimental Demonstration of Beam Storage by Three-Dimensional Spiral Injection Scheme for Ultra-Compact Storage Rings",
  "abstract": "Three-dimensional spiral injection enables beam storage in ultra-compact rings with nanosecond revolution periods. We report first storage of a $297 \\, \\mathrm{keV/}c$ electron beam in a $22 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$ weak-focusing ring with a $4.7\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ revolution period using a $140\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ kicker pulse. A scintillating-fiber detector observes signals $>5σ$ above noise for $\\geq 1\\, \\mathrm{μs}$, and varying the weak-focusing field potential shifts the stored-beam region, consistent with Monte Carlo predictions, validating beam storage. This proof-of-principle opens a path to ultra-compact storage rings for next-generation precision measurements.",
