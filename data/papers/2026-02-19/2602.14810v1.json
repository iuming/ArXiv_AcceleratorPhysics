  "title": "Excavation of a 69-m diameter and 94-m high cavern for the Hyper-Kamiokande detector",
  "abstract": "The excavation of the Hyper-Kamiokande cavern, 600 m underground, is complete. Measuring 69 m in diameter and 94 m in height, it is among the world's largest rock caverns. A vertically oriented, dome-capped cylindrical design was chosen to optimize cost and performance. Combined with substantial overburden, the geometry posed major engineering challenges. This paper outlines the underground works, main cavern design, excavation plan, and the evolution of support design and construction methods during excavation, namely the information-based (observational) design and construction approach.",
