  "title": "Review of prototypes developed in a 65 nm CMOS imaging technology in view of vertexing applications at a future lepton collider",
  "abstract": "The OCTOPUS project addresses the development and characterization of monolithic active pixel sensors in the TPSCo 65 nm ISC technology in view of vertexing applications at a future lepton collider. Meeting the corresponding requirements -- outlined in the ECFA detector road map -- will necessitate the simulation, design, and testing of prototypes and a demonstrator chip in this very process.   This work reviews the literature on existing prototypes, summarizing their design characteristics, properties, and performance in charged-particle detection, and provides an overview of previous simulation efforts. The presented results suggest the feasibility of the endeavor while showcasing challenges, the need for further investigations, and providing a foundation for imminent design choices.",
