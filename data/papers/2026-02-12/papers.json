    "title": "Charged particle motion in a strong magnetic field: The first order expansion",
    "abstract": "We provide a mathematically rigorous derivation of the first order expansion of the motion of a charged particle in a strong magnetic field. In contrast to the derivations that can be found in the physics literature we solely assume throughout that the magnetic field is strong. In particular we do not need to make any structural assumptions on the particle motion, such as the gyroradius being small in comparison to the magnetic length scale. Instead, some of the additional assumptions which are usually made in the physics literature turn out to be an a posteriori consequence in our approach. Our approach further justifies the utilisation of the guiding centre approximation at \"bounce points\" within magnetic mirrors, a situation which violates the usual assumptions which are made in the physics literature when deriving the guiding centre approximation.",

    "title": "A Helical-Deflector-Based Radio-Frequency Spiral Scanning System for keV Energy Electrons",
    "abstract": "We present the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a radio-frequency based time-to-position conversion system for keV electrons incorporating a helical deflector operating in the 400-1000 MHz range. The device performs circular deflection of the electrons when driven by a single RF frequency and enables spiral scanning when two phase-locked RF voltages with slightly different frequencies are applied. The superposition of the two phase-locked RF voltages produces an amplitude-beating field whose slowly varying envelope modulates the deflection radius, transforming the circular scan into a controlled spiral on the detector plane. A detailed theoretical model describing the electron dynamics under two phase-locked RF voltages with different frequencies was derived, yielding analytical expressions for the transverse velocity and radius-vector components at the deflector exit. Spiral scanning will allow measurements with picosecond resolution in a time range 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the period of the circular scanning.",

    "title": "Interstellar Medium Modulation of Nonlinear Kinetic Alfvén Morphology in Structured Galactic Environments",
    "abstract": "We present a spatially dependent framework for the existence and propagation of nonlinear kinetic Alfvén (KA) structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). Using a multi-component analytical model that incorporates the diffuse warm ionized medium together with localized H II regions, supernova remnants (SNR), and stellar-wind bubbles (SWB), we derive location-dependent coefficients governing KA dispersion and nonlinearity. The reductive perturbation method is applied to obtain Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, enabling the characterization of solitons under realistic astrophysical conditions. Numerical analysis demonstrates how superthermality, plasma $β$, temperature, and density gradients modulate soliton amplitude, width, and stability. Our results reveal distinct exclusion zones (EZs) for KA solitons in high-$β$ HII regions and SWB/SNR interiors, as well as ultra low-$β$ regions near central pulsar wind nebulae. While H II regions exhibit simple Gaussian-driven depletions, the complex ``hole-and-shell\" morphologies of SWBs and SNRs imprint sharp spatial variations and discontinuities on soliton properties. This study establishes a direct link between macroscopic ISM morphology, ion-kinetic scale dissipation, and the emergence of coherent Alfvénic activity, with implications for radio scattering, pulsar scintillation, and fine-scale signatures in astrophysical observations.",

    "title": "Kinetic renormalization of auroral turbulence",
    "abstract": "Driven-dissipative systems often exhibit self-organization in the form of coherent dissipative structures. However, observing such critical states in natural plasmas remains elusive, leading to the traditional view that the fine structure of Earth's auroral ionosphere is shaped by local turbulent flows. Here we report the discovery of a self-organizing regime in Earth's ionosphere. We identify this by modeling the sum of saturation electric fields in the turbulent auroral electrojets as a stochastic variable that renormalizes into noise-enabled transport, via explicitly derived Bohm diffusion. This constitutes an effective field-theory for Farley-Buneman turbulence in the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism for renormalization group theory, for which we provide strong empirical evidence. Using a composite radar-GPS power spectrum of plasma turbulence, we resolve a scale-invariant cascade that exhibits a characteristic kinetic Alfvén $k^{-8/3}$-signature across four orders of magnitude in $k$. What is more, a large statistical analysis of how the turbulence responds to magnetospheric driving reveals a clear tendency for the observed number density of turbulent waves to scale linearly with driving power, matching the predictions made by our field theory's overdamped equations of motion, which offer closed-form calculations of macroscopic transport relations that are uniquely suitable for sub-grid parameterization in space weather modeling. This establishes geospace storms as opportunities to observe non-equilibrium phase transitions imposing global constraints on collision-dominated systems.",

    "title": "High-voltage generation system for a traveling-wave Stark decelerator",
    "abstract": "In this paper we describe the high-voltage generation system we have developed for a traveling-wave Stark decelerator (TWSD). The TWSD can reduce the forward velocity of a molecular beam of heavy neutral polar molecules such as strontium monofluoride (SrF) and barium monofluoride (BaF) from $\\sim$ 200 m/s down to $\\sim$ 6 m/s. The main motivation for the development of this device is the increased sensitivity from precision spectroscopy of the decelerated molecules to test fundamental physics. The high-voltage generation system can produce eight pulsed sinusoidal waveforms with a maximum amplitude of 10 kV and a linear frequency sweep from 16.7 kHz down to 500 Hz over the span of 40 ms at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The eight waveforms are phase-offset to each other by 45 degrees. To slow down the heavy molecules, the decelerator is required to have a length of $\\sim$ 4 m, which results in a significant capacitive coupling between adjacent channels of $\\sim$ 160 pF. As a consequence, the control and stability of the waveforms is extra challenging. We designed a method that compensates for the frequency-dependent coupling between the eight channels. Allowing for amplitude and phase-offsets that do not deviate more than 1% and 2 degrees, respectively, from their design values during the frequency sweep. The system outperforms commercially available options in terms of stability, output voltage amplitude, cost and ease of maintenance. This approach is also relevant for other fields where precise control of high-voltage waveforms is required, such as particle accelerator physics, plasma physics and mass spectroscopy.",

    "title": "Fully nonlinear phenomenology of the bump-on-tail (BOT) instability with drag, diffusion and Krook relaxation",
    "abstract": "Energetic-particle-driven modes in magnetically confined fusion plasmas often exhibit nonlinear frequency sweeping, reflecting complex wave-particle interactions near marginal stability. While the bump-on-tail (BOT) instability within the Berk-Breizman framework has served as a canonical model for understanding such phenomena, a unified nonlinear description remains incomplete when drag, diffusion, and Krook relaxation act simultaneously. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the BOT instability that explicitly retains all three collision operators together with external wave damping. Using a validated characteristic-based BOT code, we systematically scan the multi-dimensional collision parameter space and construct nonlinear regime maps and bifurcation diagrams. To organize the rich dynamics, we introduce a two-level categorization that combines global wave-energy evolution with chirping subtypes identified from spectral morphology. We find that diffusion and Krook relaxation regularize the nonlinear dynamics and promote ordered transitions from chaotic behaviors to periodic oscillations and steady saturation as collision strength increases, with the saturation level decreasing approximately exponentially with external damping. In contrast, drag alone does not admit steady solutions and instead drives persistent or chaotic chirping through convective deformation of resonant phase-space structures. When drag is combined with diffusion or Krook relaxation, clear transition sequences emerge: increasing drag breaks hole-clump symmetry, broadens the effective resonance region, and drives systematic transitions from transient to intermittent and persistent chirping.",

    "title": "The high speed analog optical readout system designed for low temperature experiments",
    "abstract": "For low-temperature experiments such as liquid xenon dark matter detectors, it is crucial to read out detector signals from cryostats. Traditionally, photoelectrical signals are transmitted from the cryogenic region to the outside using coaxial cables through vacuum feedthroughs on the cryostats. In this paper, we investigate an analog optical transmission method in which the raw electrical signals are converted into optical signals with light intensity linearly proportional to the electrical amplitude, transmitted out of the cryogenic environment through optical fiber, and subsequently converted back into electrical signals by photoelectric devices while preserving the signal waveform. This new approach offers advantages, including low attenuation over long-distance transmission and reduced crosstalk across the feedthroughs. Additionally, the low-temperature optical wavelength multiplexing scheme has been investigated and applied, increasing the transmission capability of a single fiber. At -100 degree Celsius, the proposed analog optical readout system achieves a -3dB bandwidth of larger than 150MHz, a dynamic range of up to 500mV, and a low cryogenic-region power consumption of 70mW per channel, demonstrating its strong potential for low-temperature experiments.",

    "title": "Unidentified falling objects in the LHC as dark matter signals",
    "abstract": "Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs) refer to sporadic beam losses observed during LHC operation. The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($Ω_\\mathrm{DM}\\simΩ_\\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs.",

    "abstract": "Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open problems in modern physics, motivating experimental searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Despite extensive efforts employing diverse detection strategies, large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. We report a high-statistics laboratory search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $γ$-ray cascades using approximately $100~\\mathrm{kg}$ of CsI(Tl) scintillators operated at Texas A\\&M University. The experiment employs a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source and a ``missing-$γ$'' technique, in which the absence of a photon from a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance-disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, enabling sensitivity to significantly weaker couplings. The setup provides simultaneous sensitivity to a broad class of light dark-sector candidates, including axions and axion-like particles, dark scalars, and dark photons in the $0.1 - 1 \\text{ MeV}$ mass region. Through careful control of detector containment, energy resolution, and environmental backgrounds, we excludes certain regions on the previously explored parameter space. With foreseeable improvements in detector volume and systematic uncertainty control, this technique has the potential to probe currently unexplored parameter space for axion-like particles and light dark scalars.",

    "title": "Bridging the Kinetic-Fluid Gap: Ion-Driven Magnetogenesis to Prime Cosmic Dynamos",
    "abstract": "The origin of cosmic magnetic fields is widely attributed to the amplification of weak seed fields by turbulent dynamos. However, a critical understanding gap remains between the microscopic generation of these seeds and the macroscopic onset of the dynamo. Current kinetic models, often constrained to electron scales, predict premature saturation via magnetic trapping, leaving the generated fields potentially too weak and small-scale to effectively prime magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Here, using high-resolution kinetic simulations with a realistic mass ratio, we reveal the physics of this unexplored ion-kinetic regime. Under generalized continuous shear driving, used to simulate ubiquitous macroscopic flows, we demonstrate that the saturation of electron instabilities is not the endpoint but a precursor to a distinct, ion-dominated evolution. Massive ions, sustaining the velocity shear, trigger a subsequent filamentation instability that accesses the vast ion kinetic energy reservoir. This mechanism amplifies the magnetic energy by orders of magnitude beyond the electron-saturation limit, expanding the field coherence to ion scales. Our results establish ion kinetics as the essential ''missing link'' that bridges the divide between microscopic plasma instabilities and macroscopic cosmic dynamos.",

    "title": "Design of experiments characterising heat conduction in magnetised, weakly collisional plasma",
    "abstract": "Heat conduction in weakly collisional, magnetised plasma is challenging to model accurately due to multifaceted physics governing heat-carrying electrons, including microinstabilities that scatter electrons and modify heat transport. Capturing these effects requires multidimensional kinetic theory simulations, which are computationally expensive. Experimental constraints overcome this issue, resulting in improved understanding of thermal transport in systems such as the intra-cluster medium of galaxy clusters, and the hot-spot in inertial confinement fusion. In this paper, we present a new experimental platform that produces a weakly collisional high-\\b{eta} plasma expected to be susceptible to the whistler heat-flux instability. This platform, to be fielded on the Orion laser, enables characterisation of whistler-regulated thermal conductivity. The platform design is assessed using radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the code FLASH. Simulations using three thermal conduction models predict conductivity suppression by over an order of magnitude relative to the Spitzer value at whistler saturation, demonstrating the efficacy of the platform.",

    "title": "Deflation Techniques for Stellarator Equilibrium and Optimization",
    "abstract": "Stellarator optimization is a multi-objective, non-convex problem characterized by a complex objective landscape containing many local minima. The solution resulting from a single optimization is highly sensitive to factors such as the initial guess, objective weights, and the optimization method employed. However, merely varying these factors does not guarantee that a physically distinct minimum will be found; optimizations often fail to converge to good minima or simply return to the same or very similar local minima despite large-scale parameter scans. This paper presents a novel application of deflation methods to effectively explore this landscape. By modifying the objective function to penalize and \"deflate\" away already-found solutions, this technique encourages the optimizer towards attractive, distinct new minima while using a single initial guess and optimization setup. We provide a primer on deflation for nonlinear systems and non-convex optimization before applying it to non-axisymmetric equilibrium and stellarator optimization problems. Key results include the discovery of families of global equilibria with similar core characteristics and the convergence to helical core equilibria without prescient initial guesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting stage-one stellarator and stage-two coil optimization with deflation constraints readily produces multiple high-quality, distinct solutions, establishing the method's efficacy and ease of use.",

    "title": "Probing Internal Dynamics of Spatiotemporal Optical Vortex Strings: Spatiotemporal Attraction and Filament Stretching",
    "abstract": "Vortex dynamics are intriguing and challenging across multiple physics fields. In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom. However, the interaction mechanisms between multiple transverse orbital angular momentum singularities within a single wave packet remain elusive. This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time. These findings confirm the existence of interesting interactions between STOV singularities, deepen our understanding of photonics and open a new direction for investigating the complex dynamics of vortex singularities in the spatiotemporal domain.",

    "abstract": "We report on the measurement of neutron energy spectra at the newly established Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in the Republic of Korea, designed to host dark matter and rare-event search experiments. A high-sensitivity neutron spectrometer was employed, consisting of ten cylindrical {}^{3}He proportional counters, eight of which were embedded in cylindrical high-density polyethylene moderators of various sizes. To quantify and mitigate contributions from internal α-backgrounds, each detector underwent a dedicated background measurement using a cadmium-shielded box. These backgrounds, primarily originating from trace amounts of U and Th in the stainless-steel housings, were characterized and subtracted during data analysis. Neutron measurements were carried out at three locations within the Yemilab between March to October 2023. After waveform-based event selection and correction for \\alphasym-backgrounds, neutron count rates were estimated and corresponding energy spectra were reconstructed using the unfolding method. The total neutron fluence rates were measured ranged from (3.24 $\\pm$ 0.11) to (4.01 $\\pm$ 0.10) $\\times~10^{-5}~ {cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, with thermal and fast neutron components (1 - 10 MeV) ranging from (1.32 $\\pm$ 0.05) to (1.51 $\\pm$ 0.05) $\\times 10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$ and (0.27 $\\pm$ 0.03) to (0.34 $\\pm$ 0.10) $\\times~10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive characterization of resistive PICOSEC Micromegas detector prototypes, tested under identical conditions, constant drift gap, field configurations, and photocathode at the CERN SPS H4 beam line. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of resistive layer technology in gaseous timing detectors, demonstrating that robustness can be improved without compromising the excellent timing performance of PICOSEC Micromegas. Different resistive architectures and values were explored to optimize stability and ensure reliable long-term operation in challenging experimental environments. The prototype with a 10MΩ resistive layer achieved the best overall performance, with a timing resolution of 22.900 {\\pm} 0.002 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.190 {\\pm} 0.003 mm, while charge sharing across multiple pads enabled combined timing resolutions below 28 ps. A lower-resistivity (200kΩ) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response. These studies benchmark the potential of resistive layers for gaseous timing detectors and provide a foundation for scalable designs with optimized timing and spatial resolution across diverse experimental applications.",

    "title": "Conceptual Design of a Novel Highly Granular Crystal Electromagnetic Calorimeter for Future Higgs Factories",
    "abstract": "Next-generation high-energy electron-positron colliders, operating as Higgs factories, require an unprecedented jet energy resolution for precision measurements of Higgs and Z/W bosons. To address this challenge, a conceptual design is presented for a novel high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter that combines the superior intrinsic energy resolution of a homogeneous calorimeter with the fine segmentation required for particle-flow reconstruction. The crystal electromagnetic calorimeter design is based on orthogonally arranged long scintillating crystal bars read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at both ends. Key design specifications were established through comprehensive simulation studies. Critical technical considerations, including crystal choices, photosensors, electronics, mechanical support, and radiation damage, are discussed. A dedicated digitisation framework was developed to realistically model effects from the crystal, SiPMs, and readout electronics. The performance of a single calorimeter module was evaluated using simulated electron showers. Simulation results for a single module demonstrate an excellent electromagnetic energy resolution of $1.12\\%/\\sqrt{E(\\mathrm{GeV})}\\oplus0.24\\%$ and an energy linearity within $\\pm0.5\\%$ for electrons from 3 GeV to 100 GeV. The performance significantly exceeds the design requirement of $\\leq 3\\%/\\sqrt{E(\\mathrm{GeV})}\\oplus1\\%$. The results establish the feasibility of the proposed high-granularity crystal calorimeter concept and point to a promising pathway toward the precision calorimetry required for future high-energy electron-positron collider experiments.",

    "abstract": "We use a heuristic fluid model to predict the dependence of the cutoff wave number for the short-wavelength ion temperature gradient (SWITG) mode on ion density gradient, ion temperature gradient (ITG) and ion-electron temperature ratio. In particular, we predict that the cutoff wave number increases linearly with increasing ITG for sufficiently large values of the ITG. Direct numerical solutions of the gyrokinetic dispersion relation using a purpose-built solver confirm the predicted scalings at large ITG values and find a weaker power-law scaling for intermediate ITG values. Combining these wave number scalings with a simple diffusive estimate for turbulent fluxes produces a scaling prediction for the ITG heat flux in SWITG-driven turbulence. Applying the critical balance conjecture additionally provides scalings for the aspect ratio of the SWITG turbulent eddies.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has emerged as a powerful method for solving the structures of sub-micron-sized particles down to nanoparticles. However, it faces technical challenges when applied to beam-sensitive samples or conglomerated and agglomerated nanoparticles. This study presents a novel approach that combines 4D-STEM tomography with object tracking and segmentation algorithms to overcome these limitations and achieve single-crystalline 3D ED datasets from nanopowder samples. The method and data quality are assessed on brookite TiO2 nanorods and beam-sensitive CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. To finely sample the reciprocal-space, the data acquisition was automated to acquire hundreds of 4D-STEM scans using a slightly convergent beam and at fine tilt steps. The proposed method provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, low illumination time for reducing beam damage, and the ability to analyze multiple particles from a single tomographic dataset. The procedure is optimized to be feasible using commercially available desktops and detectors. This extends the method applicability in the community to the systems and samples that were previously inaccessible for conventional 3D ED methods, particularly breaking the technical challenges for the data acquisition.",

    "abstract": "We address three two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics models: reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), Hazeltine's model, and the Charney--Hasegawa--Mima (CHM) equation. These models are derived to capture the basic features of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and plasma behaviour. They all possess non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations in terms of Lie--Poisson brackets, which imply an infinite number of conservation laws along with symplecticity of the phase flow. This geometric structure in phase space affects the statistical long-time behaviour. Therefore, to capture the qualitative features in long-time numerical simulations, it is critical to use a discretization that preserves the rich phase space geometry. Here, we use the matrix hydrodynamics approach to achieve structure-preserving discretizations for each model. We furthermore carry out long-time simulations with randomized initial data and a comparison between the models. The study shows consistent behaviour for the magnetic potential: both RMHD and Hazeltine's model produce magnetic dipoles (in CHM, the magnetic potential is prescribed). These results suggest an inverse cascade of magnetic energy and of the mean-square magnetic potential, which is empirically verified via spectral scaling diagrams. On the other hand, the vorticity field dynamics differs between the models: RMHD forms sharp vortex filaments with rapidly growing vorticity values, whereas Hazeltine's model and CHM show only small variation in the vorticity values. Related to this observation, both Hazeltine's model and CHM give spectral scaling diagrams indicating an inverse cascade of kinetic energy not present in RMHD.",

    "abstract": "Relying on atomic scattering factors from evaluated databases, a new model for the reflectivity of x rays on solid surfaces has been developed for FLUKA v4-6.0. This model accounts for the variation of reflectivity as a function of the photon energy, its incidence angle, and linear polarisation; surface roughness effects are also taken into account. FLUKA reflectivities agree well with those obtained from state-of-the-art codes used for the characterization of optical devices, both for homogeneous solids and for multilayer mirrors. This new capability renders FLUKA a nearly one-stop shop for synchrotron radiation simulations: emission from bending magnets and wigglers, photon transport and interaction, electromagnetic (and hadronic when applicable) shower development in complex geometries, as well as x-ray reflection at designated solid surfaces can now be all accounted for in a single FLUKA run. This streamlined FLUKA simulation workflow greatly simplifies the plethora of simulation tools that Monte Carlo practitioners previously needed to rely on. Two application scenarios of this new reflectivity model are showcased: first, the use of a multilayer mirror to deflect x rays from an optical hutch onto an experimental hall at the MINERVA beamline of the ALBA synchrotron and, second, the assessment of the photon flux near the interaction point at the CERN's Future Circular Collider (in its electron-positron stage) as a result of upstream x-ray reflections.",

    "title": "Binary Classification of Light and Dark Time Traces of a Transition Edge Sensor Using Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "The Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) is a light shining through a wall experiment probing the existence of axions and axion-like particles using a 1064 nm laser source. While ALPS II is already taking data using a heterodyne based detection scheme, cryogenic transition edge sensor (TES) based single-photon detectors are planned to expand the detection system for cross-checking the potential signals, for which a sensitivity on the order of $10^{-24}$ W is required. In order to reach this goal, we have investigated the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) as binary classifiers to distinguish the experimentally measured 1064 nm photon triggered (light) pulses from background (dark) pulses. Despite extensive hyperparameter optimization, the CNN based binary classifier did not outperform our previously optimized cut-based analysis in terms of detection significance. This suggests that the used approach is not generally suitable for background suppression and improving the energy resolution of the TES. We partly attribute this to the training confusion induced by near-1064 nm black-body photon triggers in the background, which we identified as the limiting background source as concluded in our previous works. However, we argue that the problem ultimately lies in the binary classification based approach and believe that regression models would be better suitable for addressing the energy resolution. Unsupervised machine learning models, in particular neural network based autoencoders, should also be considered potential candidates for the suppression of noise in time traces. While the presented results and associated conclusions are obtained for TES designed to be used in the ALPS II experiment, they should hold equivalently well for any device whose output signal can be considered as a univariate time trace.",

    "title": "Enhancement of Mid-/High-Z Impurity Transport by Continuous Li-granule Dropping in a Stellarator Plasma",
    "abstract": "An enhancement of core impurity transport is observed in high-density plasmas of the stellarator LHD heated by neutral beam injection when continuous lithium (Li) granule dropping is performed. In the experiments reported here, in which the TESPEL is employed to inject trace amounts of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) into the plasma core, confinement times for these impurities are seen to reduce significantly when Li dropping is applied, this reduction being more notable for Mo. In order to gain some initial insight into these observations, simulations are performed using the drift-kinetic transport code SFINCS for the Mo case. These simulations indicate that, while neoclassical transport prevails for the main plasma components (electrons, majority ions and low Z impurities), the classical contribution seems to be dominant for transporting Mo impurities. In summary, this work reports the first experimental observation of the degradation of mid-Z and high-Z impurity confinement induced by the continuous dropping of Li granules into a high-density stellarator plasma. In the case of the Mo impurity, simulations suggest that classical transport is the key mechanism underlying the enhanced impurity transport.",

    "abstract": "Space-charge-limited (SCL) current density for time-invariant injection (under long-pulse condition) via the diode cathode is the maximum transportable density, while it can be leveraged higher when the injection pulselength becomes shorter than the transmit time for electrons (i.e., under short-pulse condition). However, both limits mentioned above apply for the time-invariant injection condition and the role of time-varying current density for injection remains elusive. In this paper, we numerically investigate the SCL electron flow with time-variant injection. Using particle-in-cell simulation, four different time-variant profiles for electron injection are enforced, and the maximum current densities are determined resulting from the space charge effect for various pulse lengths. We speculate that the time-variant density of injection via the diode cathode will contribute to transport enhancement in the short-pulse condition.",

    "abstract": "Previous experiments conducted in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX) revealed an intriguing phenomenon first referred to as imposed ordering. This occurs when micron-sized dust particles become aligned with the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above the dust (at a distance much larger than the plasma Debye length or the ion-neutral or electron-neutral mean free paths) in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the mesh. In this work, results of a transition experiment are presented wherein starting from a classical two-dimensional Coulomb crystal with hexagonal symmetry in an unmagnetized plasma $(B = 0\\,T)$, dust transitions to a state in which it flows along the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above it, mapping out the 4-fold symmetry of the boundary condition. It is hypothesized that beyond a certain magnetization, elongated electric potential structures emanating from the mesh drive the dust motion to reflect the mesh morphology, transitioning from a 6-fold self ordering to 4-fold imposed ordering. The various dust phases are quantified and a critical value of magnetic field is identified in the transition experiment indicating the onset of imposed ordering.",

    "abstract": "We establish both local and global bifurcation results for traveling periodic solutions of the one-dimensional two-species Vlasov-Poisson equation. These solutions consist of strip-like regions of ions and electrons in phase space that propagate coherently and emerge from spatially homogeneous, velocity-dependent equilibrium layers. Depending on the geometry of the underlying equilibrium and on the selected Fourier mode, the bifurcation diagram exhibits either two or four solution branches. In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis. Finally, by means of an affine change of variables, we reveal a connection with the one-dimensional two-component Euler-Poisson system, which in turn enables the construction of traveling periodic waves of both small and large amplitude for that model as well.",

    "title": "Development of a Reduced Multi-Fluid Equilibrium Model and Its Application to Proton-Boron Spherical Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "Proton-Boron fusion requires extreme ion temperatures and robust confinement, making Spherical Tokamaks (ST) with high-power neutral beam injection primary candidates. In these devices, strong toroidal rotation and the large mass disparity between protons and boron ions drive complex multi-fluid effects - specifically centrifugal species separation and electrostatic polarization - that standard single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models fail to capture. While comprehensive multi-fluid models are often numerically stiff, we develop a reduced model balancing physical fidelity with computational robustness. By retaining dominant toroidal rotation and self-consistent potential while neglecting poloidal inertia and pressure anisotropy, the model couples a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation with species-specific Bernoulli relations and a quasi-neutrality constraint. The model is applied to two representative p-B ST configurations: the experimental EHL-2 and reactor-scale EHL-3B. Simulation results demonstrate that equilibrium modifications are governed by the ion Mach number ($M$). In the low-rotation regime ($M < 0.5$), multi-fluid effects are weak and solutions approach the single-fluid limit. However, at $M > 2$, strong centrifugal forces drive significant boron accumulation at the low-field side (LFS) and generate an internal electrostatic potential on the order of 10 kV. These findings confirm the necessity of multi-fluid modeling for accurate p-$^{11}$B reactor design and establish a theoretical foundation for future investigations into stability, transport, and free-boundary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The global availability of high-intensity neutron sources is restricted by the prohibitive costs of spallation facilities and the decommissioning of aging research reactors, while compact accelerator-driven sources (CANS) are fundamentally limited by target power density and thermal-mechanical stress. Here, we introduce SYNERGY (SYnchrotron-driven NEutron source for Research, energy Generation and therapY), a paradigm-shifting architecture that overcomes these bottlenecks by decoupling charged-particle acceleration from neutron production. By utilizing a storage ring to drive external photoneutron targets via synchrotron radiation, this topological separation ensures targets interact exclusively with a continuous-wave (CW) photon beam, minimizing thermo-mechanical shocks and enabling beam powers exceeding 200 kW per beamline. Through a systematic parametric analysis cross-validated using OpenMC, MCNPX, and FLUKA, we demonstrate single-beamline neutron production rates from $2.8\\times10^{14}$ n/s to $1.3\\times10^{15}$ n/s. With an inherent multi-beamline capacity feeding up to 50 independent stations, the total facility intensity exceeds $6.0\\times10^{16}$ n/s. By bridging the gap between laboratory and national-scale infrastructure, SYNERGY provides a high-intensity, multi-user platform for subcritical systems, medical isotope production, and boron neutron capture therapy.",

We first derive the photon sphere radius and obtain an analytical expression for the deflection angle in the weak-field regime by applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). For the strong-field regime, we perform ray-tracing calculations to examine the behavior of light trajectories and determine the corresponding number of orbits. We further compute the BH shadow and gravitational lensing in a plasma medium and provide constraints arising from the DM halo parameters. We also extend our analysis to weak gravitational lensing within plasma environments, considering both uniform and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) distributions. We find the analytical expressions for the deflection angle in the presence of plasma and examine the resulting effects on image magnification. The overall results highlight how DM halo properties and plasma characteristics jointly alter observable lensing signatures.",

A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $β$.

    "abstract": "Advanced tokamak scenarios often feature weak or reversed magnetic shear configurations. In this study, the hybrid kinetic-MHD model implemented in the NIMROD code is used to investigate the effects of reversed magnetic shear on internal kink and fishbone mode in a circular shaped limiter tokamak. In the absence of energetic particles (EPs), the mode growth rate initially increases and then decreases as the magnetic shear changes from positive to negative, indicating stabilizing effects of the reversed magnetic shear on the internal kink mode. In the presence of EPs, when the reversed magnetic shear region is sufficiently narrow, the transition from internal kink/fishbone modes to double kink/fishbone modes takes place, and the stabilizing effects of the reversed magnetic shear can significantly dominate the destabilization of EPs. For non-resonant modes, the EP beta fraction $β_f$ for excitation increases with $q_{min}$, concurrent with progressively lower growth rates in non-resonant fishbone modes. When the equilibrium profile has an internal transport barrier (ITB), broader ITB widths suppress internal kink modes more effectively, whereas steeper temperature gradients strengthen EP stabilization.",

    "abstract": "The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).",

    "title": "Preprint: Sheath thickness measurements with the biased plasma impedance probe, Agreement with Child Langmuir scaling",
    "abstract": "Plasma sheaths play a central role in plasma-surface interactions, yet their thickness remains challenging to measure experimentally. Although classical analytical models such as the Child-Langmuir (CL) sheath model provide clear predictions for sheath thickness, experimental validation has been limited because most diagnostics either rely on indirect, multi-step inference (e.g., Langmuir probes) or require invasive and technically demanding techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that the plasma impedance probe (PIP), when operated with a controlled DC bias, enables relatively direct, model-informed measurements of sheath thickness that are reasonably straightforward to implement experimentally. Across a range of discharge conditions, biased-PIP sheath thickness measurements are found to follow CL scaling closely, requiring a single, consistent empirical correction factor of $α\\approx 0.74$ to reconcile the measured thickness with CL predictions. Concurrent measurements of plasma density and electron damping show that probe biasing does not significantly perturb the bulk plasma density, supporting the validity of the biased-PIP approach. Building on this validation, we leverage the empirically determined $α$ factor to extend the floating (unbiased) PIP analysis to obtain model-dependent estimates of electron temperature and plasma potential without electrical biasing. A side-by-side comparison demonstrates close agreement between floating-PIP results and those obtained from a biased Langmuir probe. Taken together, these results establish the PIP as a complementary diagnostic to the Langmuir probe, expanding the range of accessible plasma measurements while providing experimental support for classical sheath models.",

The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \\approx 1836$.

    "title": "Modelling Conduction Cooling of Superconducting Accelerator Magnets using a Thermal Thin Shell Approximation",
    "abstract": "Understanding the thermal behaviour of superconducting accelerator magnets is essential to ensure stable and reliable operation. This work presents an extension of the Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS) Multipole module to include collar and pole regions of accelerator magnets, which influences the overall thermal response. A thermal thin shell approximation (TSA), which is shown to be effective in previous works, is employed to model thermal insulation layers efficiently, replacing an insulation surface mesh. The main novelty of this work lies in the development of a method to model the thermal connection between the magnet winding and the collar and pole regions via the TSA.   To assess the accuracy and computational efficiency of the novel method, temperature and field variations are computed for a current ramp-up scenario. The thermal solution is coupled to a fully resolved magnetodynamic solution to capture the interaction between thermal and electromagnetic behaviour. The results obtained with the TSA are then compared to classical finite element (FE) solutions with explicitly meshed insulation domains. The TSA predicts the maximum temperature within 2-4% of the reference solution while substantially reducing mesh complexity and achieving up to a 5 times speed-up in computation time. While the TSA has traditionally been employed for short-duration quench simulations with high heat fluxes between magnet turns, these results demonstrate its reliability and efficiency for current ramp scenarios with low heat fluxes, significantly expanding its application range beyond what has been previously reported in the literature.   To illustrate potential applications of this new functionality, conduction cooling through the collar region is studied, comparing different cooling configurations and collar materials.",

    "title": "JOREK simulations of the X-point radiator formation and its movement in ASDEX Upgrade",
    "abstract": "Future large-scale magnetic confinement fusion reactors require operational regimes that can avoid extreme heat fluxes onto the plasma-facing components. One promising regime is the X-point radiator (XPR), which relies on a highly radiative, cold and dense plasma volume forming above the X-point, and which can be accessed via impurity seeding. Experimentally, the height of the XPR can be controlled by adjusting the seeding rate and heating power. This contribution presents axisymmetric (2D) simulations of the XPR regime in ASDEX Upgrade using the nonlinear MHD code JOREK extended with a kinetic particle framework for the main species neutrals and nitrogen impurities. With the time-dependent simulations, the progression from attached divertors to a complete detachment with the XPR formation is shown, highlighting the effects of the neutrals and impurities separately. Amidst this progression, the formation and the loss of the high-field-side high-density are observed. After the XPR is well-formed at the height of 6.8 cm, the fuelling and seeding rates are adjusted so that the XPR remains stationary. From the stationary case, the seeding rate is then changed to see how the XPR location reacts. By increasing and decreasing the seeding rate, the XPR responds by moving upwards and downwards, respectively. These simulations show JOREK's capability of simulating time-varying XPR, which will provide a baseline for the transition to 3D simulations, so the MHD activities and their interaction with the XPR can be studied.",

    "title": "A Comparative Analysis of the CERN ATLAS ITk MOPS Readout: A Feasibility Study on Production and Development Setups",
    "abstract": "The upcoming High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) necessitates a complete replacement of the ATLAS Inner Detector with the new Inner Tracker (ITk). This upgrade imposes stringent requirements on the associated Detector Control System (DCS), which is responsible for the monitoring, control, and safety of the detector. A critical component of the ITk DCS is the Monitoring of Pixel System (MOPS), which supervises the local voltages and temperatures of the new pixel detector modules. This paper introduces a dedicated testbed and verification methodology for the MOPS readout, defining a structured set of test cases for two DCS-readout architectures: a preliminary Raspberry Pi-based controller, the \"MOPS-Hub Mock-up\"(MH Mock-up), and the final production FPGA-based \"MOPS-Hub\" (MH). The methodology specifies the measurement chain for end-to-end latency, jitter, and data integrity across CAN and UART interfaces, including a unified time-stamping scheme, non-intrusive signal taps, and a consistent data-logging and analysis pipeline. This work details the load profiles and scalability scenarios (baseline operation, full-crate stress, and CAN Interface Card channel isolation), together with acceptance criteria and considerations for measurement uncertainty to ensure reproducibility. The objective is to provide a clear, repeatable procedure to qualify the MH architecture for production and deployment in the ATLAS ITk DCS. A companion paper will present the experimental results and the comparative analysis obtained using this testbed.",

Perturbation technique and quasi-static approximation (QSA) have been used to study the generated fields in nonlinear regime.

Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code FBPIC is used to validate analytical findings. Simulation studies also show that the generated THz radiation field propagates beyond the plasma boundary, indicating coherent electromagnetic radiation emission. Furthermore, the field amplitude scales nonlinearly with plasma density and increases linearly with external magnetic field strength, highlighting the role of these parameters in controlling radiation amplitude.",

    "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of the horizontal vertex $(x,y)$ from the S2 electroluminescence pattern is essential for fiducialization and background rejection in dual-phase argon time projection chambers. In this work, we perform a Geant4-based simulation study using the G4DS framework to investigate how detector geometry, in particular the distance between the top photodetector plane and the gas pocket, impacts S2-based XY reconstruction. A compact dual-phase argon TPC instrumented with seven Hamamatsu R8520-506 PMTs is simulated with electron recoils at 41.5 keV (corresponding to the ${}^{83m}\\mathrm{Kr}$ calibration energy), as well as 1.0 keV to probe the low-S2 regime. The PMT array height is scanned from 0 mm to 50 mm, and XY positions are reconstructed using a geometrical solid-angle (GSA) method with the S2 emission modeled by 1 mm-thick slices across the 7 mm gas pocket. The results show a clear non-monotonic dependence of reconstruction bias and resolution on PMT height, driven by the trade-off between S2 light sharing and photon statistics. These findings provide guidance for geometry optimization in future low-threshold dual-phase argon detectors and will be validated with upcoming prototype measurements.",

Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.",

    "title": "Effects of Turbulent Energy Exchange between Electrons and Ions on Global Temperature Profiles",
    "abstract": "Microscale turbulence drives not only particle and heat transport but also energy exchange between different particle species. Previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that turbulent energy exchange can exceed collisional exchange in weakly collisional plasmas, and that ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence may hinder ion heating by alpha-heated electrons. In addition, it has been clarified that trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence transfers energy from electrons to ions, thereby enhancing ion heating. In this work, we extend these studies by examining the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles at a steady state using the one-dimensional transport solver GOTRESS. For the case of DIII-D discharge 128913 [A. E. White et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056116 (2008)], turbulent energy exchange has minimal influence on temperature profiles. However, in the case of enhanced electron heating in a DIIID like tokamak plasma, energy transfer from hot electrons to cold ions driven by TEM turbulence becomes comparable to, or even exceeds, the collisional contribution, leading to a significant increase in the ion temperature profile. For ITER Baseline and SPARC standard H-mode scenarios [N.T. Howard et al., Nucl. Fusion 65, 016002(2024), P. Rodriguez Fernandez et al., J. Plasma Phys. 86, 865860503(2020)], the turbulent energy exchange is largely compensated by the collisional one, producing only small effects. These results indicate that the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles in steady state conditions of future fusion reactor scenarios is expected to be negligibly small, although it can become significant in situations such as plasma start up phases, where the heating power is strongly unbalanced between electrons and ions.",

    "title": "Unified Model of Heated Plasma Expansion",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the need to predict plasma density and temperature distributions created in the early stages of high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, we develop a fluid model of plasma expansion into vacuum that incorporates external heating. We propose a new three-parameter family of self-similar solutions for plasma expansion that models a wide range of spatiotemporal variations of the electron temperature. Depending on the relative scales of the heated plasma domain $L$, the Debye length $λ_D$ and an emergent ion-acoustic correlation length $λ_s$, characterized by the parameters $\\frac{λ_s}{λ_D}$ and $\\frac{L}{λ_s}$, a spectrum of dynamical behaviors for the expanding plasma are identified. The behavior is classified into five dynamical regimes, ranging from nearly quasineutral expansion to the formation of bare ion slabs susceptible to Coulomb explosion. Self-similar solutions with spatially uniform electron temperature with exponential time dependence are analyzed, and the dynamics in the five asymptotic limits in the parameter space are detailed. Scaling relations for the length scales and energies of the expanding plasma are proposed. The self-similar framework is applied to laser-plasma interactions, specifically addressing the plasma dynamics at a target surface as the target interacts with the rising laser intensity envelope. The results offer insights into the expansion behavior based on the laser-plasma parameters, and scaling relations for optimizing laser-plasma schemes and guiding experimental designs in high-intensity laser experiments.",

    "abstract": "The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures, and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with both analytical models and polarisation observations.",

    "title": "A flexible and differentiable coil proxy for stellarator equilibrium optimization",
    "abstract": "Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most current stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: stage-1 for the equilibrium and stage-2 for a coil design that reproduces its magnetic configuration. Because few proxies connect both stages, two-stage optimization can produce plasmas that have high-quality physical properties but overly complex coils. In recent years, single-stage optimization is increasingly used to optimize the plasma and coils simultaneously, in order to improve the plasma-coil balance. However, all existing single-stage tools are specialized for filament coils, cannot model coil systems containing permanent magnets (PM) or dipole arrays, and remain challenged by numerical problems.The quasi-single-stage (QSS) optimization finds a middle-ground by integrating a coil optimization subproblem into stage-1 optimization. We present a flexible, differentiable coil complexity proxy based on the newly developed QUADCOIL coil optimization code. QUADCOIL is fast and can target realistic coil metrics and constraints that are unavailable to codes with comparable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the QUADCOIL proxy by presenting two QSS optimization studies. The first study produces a permanent magnet solution for the MUSE stellarator with 29% fewer magnets than previous solutions. The second study produces a coil solution for the ARIES-CS stellarator with approx 30% reductions in both peak and average coil force.",

    "title": "Dipole Localization Using An Integrated Radio Frequency Atomic Magnetometer",
    "abstract": "Optically-pumped atomic magnetometers have previously been used in arrays to reject interference from far away sources and enable the sensitive detection of local sources of radio frequency (RF) signals, useful, for instance, in the detection of low field NMR signals in an unshielded environment. We now demonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are used to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The methodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two different positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known orientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of measuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their environment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of hidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer to make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it is to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working simultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of a fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are safely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The portable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in the field work.",

It is shown that such undulators can be employed for generating photons in the so-called composite twisted states -- the states that are linear superpositions of modes with definite projections of the total angular momentum, amplitudes, relative phases, and polarizations. We find the explicit expressions and the selection rules for these parameters and establish that they can be governed in a predictable way by adjusting the parameters of the multifrequency helical undulator. In particular, the phases of three arbitrary modes admissible by selection rules in the composite state with definite energy can be made arbitrary by tuning the phases of one-frequency undulators comprising the three-frequency one. By solving Diophantine equations, we obtain simple expressions for the complex amplitude of coherent state of photons emitted by a three-frequency helical undulator and for the average number of radiated twisted photons in the case when the ratios of frequencies of the three-frequency undulator are rational numbers. The development of resonances and the control of composite states of radiated photons are studied numerically confirming the theoretical conclusions.",

It is shown that helical multifrequency undulators can be employed as a bright and versatile source of photons in the states that are superpositions of the modes with definite projection of total angular momentum (TAM), amplitude, and relative phase. All these parameters of the state are readily controlled by the undulator design. The explicit expression for the amplitude of radiation of a twisted photon from a charged particle in the multifrequency undulator is derived. The energy spectrum of radiation and the selection rules for the TAM projection of radiated photons are described. The symmetry properties of the spectrum with respect to the TAM projection are established. The interpretation to the energy spectrum and to the selection rules is given in terms of virtual photons mediating between the charged particle and the undulator. The results obtained are also applicable to radiation of twisted photons produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles moving in plane multifrequency electromagnetic waves.",
