  "title": "Magnetic Alloy/Ferrite cavities",
  "abstract": "RF cavities loaded with magnetic alloy (MA) or ferrite ring cores are used in synchrotrons and storage rings if the maximum RF frequency is in the order of a few MHz. A simple model for the description of cavities of this type is derived. The most important parameters are defined, and some properties of the material and of the cavity are summarized. Different cavity configurations, development aspects, and several practical topics are covered. A few specific ferrite- and MA-loaded cavity systems are discussed as examples.",
