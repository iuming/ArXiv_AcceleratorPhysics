  "title": "Benchmarking the Use of BPM Quadrupole Moments to Measure Emittance",
  "abstract": "For the PIP-II program, transverse emittance in the Fermilab Booster must remain well controlled at higher bunch intensities. 4-plate beam position monitors (BPMs) have a small but measurable quadrupole moment, making it possible to infer transverse emittance. By compositing many BPMs together, it becomes possible to improve the quality of the quadrupole signal. The Fermilab Booster BPM system has been used to measure these quadrupole moments in the past year and derive emittances from them. Recent benchmarks show that the derived BPM emittances show similar emittance evolution and value to IPM and Multiwire data. This approach can both supplement and complement existing non-intercepting emittance monitors in accelerators.",
