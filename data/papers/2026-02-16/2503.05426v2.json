  "title": "Geant4 and FLUKA Simulations of a Cyclotron Based 30 MeV Proton-Beryllium Reaction: Benchmarking and Optimization of Neutron Fields",
  "abstract": "For studies where a reliable neutron source/beam is required and a nuclear reactor is not a viable option (considering their high neutron flux supply, which may not be suitable for research concerning low flux operations), alternative approaches may be sought. We present a comprehensive simulation analysis of 30 MeV proton induced ${}^9\\mathrm{Be}\\text{(p,n)}{}^9\\mathrm{B}$ reaction, which can be utilized as an isotropic neutron source. This energy was chosen as it was the maximum allowed limit of protons supplied by IBA's Cyclone 30 XP proton cyclotron. Due to different underlying physics and transport mechanisms, when it comes to numerical calculations, slight variations in findings between different toolkits may occur. Hence it may require one to have a guide at hand to address the differences and interpret the data more accurately before conducting the actual experiment. In this work present the different numerical results of Geant4 and FLUKA. We conducted preliminary Monte Carlo runs to estimate the resulting neutron fluence and prompt gamma dose equivalents, while also assessing the degree of moderation achieved by different thicknesses of high density polyethylene. Furthermore, this work also presents an examplar modular irradiation station designed for target-moderator configurations, with the capability of generating thermal neutron fields.",
