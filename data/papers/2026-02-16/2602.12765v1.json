  "title": "Demonstration of ultra-low emittance beams in a kHz laser wakefield accelerator and application to electron diffraction",
  "abstract": "We present a compact, cost-effective method for measuring the emittance of kHz-repetition-rate laser-wakefield accelerated electron beams using a permanent solenoid. The measured normalized emittance, $ε_n = 124\\,\\mathrm{nm \\cdot rad}$ ($\\simeq 0.04 π\\,\\mathrm{mm \\cdot mrad}$) at $2.7\\,$MeV, is comparable to that of ultra-low emittance radiofrequency guns used for electron diffraction. Leveraging this low emittance, we successfully applied the electron beam to electron diffraction. We demonstrate diffraction images obtained from a single crystal Silicon nano-membrane sample, clearly resolving diffraction peaks across multiple orders.",
