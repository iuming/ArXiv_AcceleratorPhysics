  "title": "High-precision beam profile measurement with a microchannel-plate detector in the high magnetic field of the WISArD experiment",
  "abstract": "We present the development and characterization of a compact low-energy ion beam diagnostic for the WISArD (Weak Interaction Studies with $\\mathrm{^{32}Ar}$ Decay) experiment at ISOLDE/CERN. The microchannel plate (MCP) detector, which is configured in a Z-stack and has a resistive position sensitive anode, was tested with both stable and radioactive beams. This work focuses on the image reconstruction method, which corrects the pincushion distortion inherent to the square-shaped resistive anode, and investigates the influence of the magnetic field on the detector performance. Our results demonstrate that the detector achieves beam profile measurements with sub-millimeter accuracy, while coping with the spatial and high-magnetic field (4 T) constraints of the experiment. These capabilities meet the precision requirements of the WISArD experiment for extracting the modified beta-neutrino angular correlation coefficient, ã$_{βν}$, with an uncertainty of 0.1%.",
