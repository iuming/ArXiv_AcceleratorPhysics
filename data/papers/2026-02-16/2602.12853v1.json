  "title": "R&D Efforts in Cherenkov Imaging Technologies for Particle Identification in Future Experiments",
  "abstract": "Cherenkov imaging detectors will continue to play a central role for particle identification in future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Growing demands on momentum coverage, timing precision, radiation tolerance, and sustainability have driven extensive R&D in detector concepts, radiator materials, and photon sensors. This article reviews recent efforts, focusing on experiments leading advances in sensor technology, radiator materials, and the exploitation of Cherenkov photon timing to push PID limits, while highlighting synergies across experiments in addressing common challenges.",
