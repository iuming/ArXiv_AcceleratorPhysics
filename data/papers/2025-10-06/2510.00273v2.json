  "title": "Physical Thickness Characterization of the FRIB Production Targets",
  "abstract": "The FRIB heavy-ion accelerator, commissioned in 2022, is a leading facility   for producing rare isotope beams (RIBs) and exploring nuclei beyond the limits of stability.   These RIBs are produced via reactions between stable primary beams and a graphite target.   Approximately 20-40 \\% of the primary beam power is deposited in the target,   requiring efficient thermal dissipation.   Currently, FRIB operates with a primary beam power of up to 20 kW. To enhance thermal dissipation efficiency,   a single-slice rotating graphite target with a diameter of approximately 30 cm is employed.   The effective target region is a 1 cm-wide outer rim of the graphite disc.   To achieve high RIB production rates, the areal thickness variation must be constrained within 2 \\%.   This paper presents physical thickness characterizations of FRIB production targets with various nominal thicknesses,   measured using a custom-built non-contact thickness measurement apparatus.",
