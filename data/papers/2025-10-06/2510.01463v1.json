  "title": "Noise Modeling and Calibration of a Two-Stage Cryogenic Charge Amplifier   for the SPLENDOR Experiment",
  "abstract": "The SPLENDOR Collaboration studies novel narrow-gap semiconductors and engineered a substrate agnostic detector platform to achieve $\\mathcal{O}$(meV) energy sensitivity designed for low mass dark matter searches. This was achieved using low-capacitance and low-noise commercial CryoHEMTs in a split-stage topology integrated throughout a dilution refrigerator. Designed with a source-follower HEMT at the base temperature stage and a voltage amplifier at 4\\,K, this amplifier has input-limited voltage noise of 10 $\\text{nV}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ and current noise of 100 $\\text{aA}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at 1kHz. In agreement with this noise level and a photon calibration, this amplifier has a $\\text{19} \\pm \\text{4} $ electron resolution.",
