  "title": "Accurate Modelling of Intrabeam Scattering and its Impact on   Photoinjectors for Free-Electron Lasers",
  "abstract": "Intrabeam scattering (IBS) is a fundamental effect that can limit the performance of high-brightness electron machines, yet it has so far been neglected in standard modelling of RF photoinjectors. Recent measurements at SwissFEL reveal that the slice energy spread (SES) in the injector is significantly underestimated by conventional tracking codes. In this work, we present a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation model that accurately predicts the IBS-induced SES growth in the photoinjector of an X-ray free-electron laser. The simulations are benchmarked against SES measurements at the SwissFEL as well as theoretically supported by a new analytical model. The results demonstrate that IBS-induced SES growth occurs throughout the injector, most prominently in the electron source, and must be taken into account when assessing photoinjector performance. We further show that while the 5D brightness is largely conserved, the 6D brightness undergoes notable degradation with propagation, underscoring the need to include IBS in the accurate design and optimization of photoinjectors.",
