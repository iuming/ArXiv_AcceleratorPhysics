  "title": "In Situ Observation of Proton-Induced DNA Fragmentation in the Bragg   Peak: Evidence for a Protective Role of Water",
  "abstract": "We report in situ single-molecule measurements of proton-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA immersed in water, using real-time fluorescence tracking along the entire proton path, including the Bragg peak region. By chemically suppressing radical-mediated processes, we isolate direct DNA damage mechanisms and determine DSB cross sections as a function of depth. Near the Bragg peak, we observe a tenfold reduction in DSB cross sections in aqueous DNA compared to dry DNA, providing quantitative evidence for the protective role of water. These findings highlight the importance of intermolecular energy dissipation in mitigating radiation-induced damage in condensed biological matter, with implications for radiobiology and proton therapy modeling.",
