  "title": "Physics insights from a large-scale 2D UEDGE simulation database for   detachment control in KSTAR",
  "abstract": "A large-scale database of two-dimensional UEDGE simulations has been developed to study detachment physics in KSTAR and to support surrogate models for control applications. Nearly 70,000 steady-state solutions were generated, systematically scanning upstream density, input power, plasma current, impurity fraction, and anomalous transport coefficients, with magnetic and electric drifts across the magnetic field included. The database identifies robust detachment indicators, with strike-point electron temperature at detachment onset consistently Te around 3-4 eV, largely insensitive to upstream conditions. Scaling relations reveal weaker impurity sensitivity than one-dimensional models and show that heat flux widths follow Eich's scaling only for uniform, low D and Chi. Distinctive in-out divertor asymmetries are observed in KSTAR, differing qualitatively from DIII-D. Complementary time-dependent simulations quantify plasma response to gas puffing, with delays of 5-15 ms at the outer strike point and approximately 40 ms for the low-magnetic-field-side (LFS) radiation front. These dynamics are well captured by first-order-plus-dead-time (FOPDT) models and are consistent with experimentally observed detachment-control behavior in KSTAR [Gupta et al., submitted to Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion (2025)]",
