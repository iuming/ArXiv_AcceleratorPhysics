    "abstract": "The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL is upgrading several LLRF systems for its Linac and Sub-Harmonic Bunchers, where it is desired to have a unified LLRF system design to support various RF frequencies (at 125MHz, 500MHz and 3GHz) and configurations. This paper demonstrates an open-source, direct sampling RFSoC based LLRF system design, featuring: sample-to-sample Multi-Tile Synchronization, deterministic latency, digital up/down conversion, arbitrary waveform generation and acquisition, in-pulse closed loop control, timing and EPICS integration, modular RF frontend and hardware designs. Measured RF characteristics show that the RFSoC based LLRF system is able to meet the system requirements.",

    "title": "Leakage current of high-fluence neutron-irradiated 8\" silicon sensors   for the CMS Endcap Calorimeter Upgrade",
    "abstract": "The HL-LHC will challenge the detectors with a nearly 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity compared to the previous LHC runs combined, thus the CMS detector will be upgraded to face the higher levels of radiation and the larger amounts of collision data to be collected. The High-Granularity Calorimeter will replace the current endcap calorimeters of the CMS detector. It will facilitate the use of particle-flow calorimetry with its unprecedented transverse and longitudinal readout/trigger segmentation, with more than 6M readout channels. The electromagnetic section as well as the high-radiation regions of the hadronic section of the HGCAL (fluences above $10^{14}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$) will be equipped with silicon pad sensors, covering a total area of 620 m$^2$. Fluences up to $10^{16}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$ and doses up to 1.5 MGy are expected. The sensors are processed on novel 8\" p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300 $\\mu{}m$, 200 $\\mu{}m$ and 120 $\\mu{}m$ and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the wafer area and tiling. Each sensor contains several hundred individually read out cells of two sizes (around 0.6 cm$^2$ or 1.2 cm$^2$). To investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, the sensors have been irradiated with neutrons at RINSC to fluences between $6.5 \\times 10^{14}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$ and $1.4 \\times 10^{16}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$. Electrical characterization results are presented for full sensors, as well as for partial sensors cut from multi-geometry wafers with internal dicing lines on the HV potential within the active sensor area. Leakage current behaviour is investigated for various sensor types and fluence levels, including its temperature dependence. Finally, methods to limit the annealing time of the sensors during irradiation are investigated by analysing the impact of splitting high-fluence irradiations.",

    "title": "Influence of an external static magnetic field on prebreakdown electron   emission and heating",
    "abstract": "High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.",

    "title": "Experimental and numerical study on Following Streamer mechanism for SF6   breakdown induced by floating linear metal particles",
    "abstract": "A recently proposed Following Streamer mechanism (Feng et al. 2025 Phys. Rev. Applied 23 064039) seeks to explain how floating metal particles induce SF6 streamer breakdown in the combined gap. This mechanism is derived from a 2D axisymmetric fluid model, which has limitations in describing multiple streamer events in real-world 3D scenarios. To validate the Following Streamer mechanism, we experimentally investigate the discharge morphology of SF6 streamers induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative pulsed voltage. The results are then compared with those from 2D axisymmetric fluid simulations. The comparison reveals both consistencies and discrepancies. Regarding consistencies, experimentally observed features-such as streamer inception at both ends of the metal particle and the formation of subsequent following streamers-support the general idea of the Following Streamer mechanism. Regarding discrepancies, the experiments show a larger number of following streamers and off-axis propagation paths, which cannot be described in the 2D simulation. For scientific rigor, an extended physical model was proposed to improve the description of the Following Streamer mechanism.",

    "title": "Unlocking New Frontiers: The Versatile Potential of the Brazilian   Multipurpose Reactor",
    "abstract": "The multipurpose nature of nuclear research reactors has been investigated. This class of reactors has gained momentum within the international community, given the multiple benefits of nuclear technology in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the development of new materials, being characterized by the simultaneous use of several applications. In this context, Brazil has recently joined the group of countries with multipurpose reactor projects. The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) will be Brazil's new neutron source, with a thermal power of $30$ $MW$, with a core flux on the order of $\\phi=4\\times 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$ and a power density of $312.5$ $W/cm^3$, ensuring the production of radioisotopes, material and fuel irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In this work, the demand for neutron fluxes in different irradiation targets is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations under a perturbation caused by a highly neutron-absorbing material, the Gadolinium-157 (Gd-157) isotope. The results show that Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) production is not affected by the Gd-157 target, and the minimum proposed thermal neutron flux for the reactor's activity ($\\phi_{min}=5.1\\times 10^{12}$ $n/cm^{2}s$) is guaranteed even at maximum operational capacity. The potential production of Terbium (Tb) isotopes for nuclear medicine applications in the RMB is briefly discussed.",

    "title": "Uncertainty quantification of a multi-component Hall thruster model at   varying facility pressures",
    "abstract": "Bayesian inference is applied to calibrate and quantify prediction uncertainty in a coupled multi-component Hall thruster model. The model consists of cathode, discharge, and plume sub-models and outputs thruster performance metrics, one-dimensional plasma properties, and the angular distribution of the current density in the plume. The simulated thrusters include a magnetically shielded thruster operating on krypton, the H9, and an unshielded thruster operating on xenon, the SPT-100, at pressures between 4.3--43 $\\mu$Torr-Kr and 1.7--80 $\\mu$Torr-Xe, respectively. After calibration, the model captures key pressure-related trends, including changes in thrust and upstream shifts in the ion acceleration region. Furthermore, the model exhibits predictive accuracy to within 10\\% when evaluated on flow rates and pressures not included in the training data, and can predict some performance characteristics across test facilities to within the same range of conditions. Compared to a previous model calibrated on some of the same data [Eckels et al. 2024], the model reduced predictive errors in thrust and discharge current by greater than 50%. An extrapolation to on-orbit performance is performed with an error of 9%, capturing trends in discharge current but not thrust. These findings are discussed in the context of using data for predictive Hall thruster modeling in the presence of facility effects.",

    "abstract": "In general, optimizing chromaticity and transverse feedback parameters is important in suppressing beam instabilities for stable operation in high-intensity proton machines. Meanwhile, space charge effects impact the intrabunch motion of the proton bunch within a large chromaticity region in the machines, such as the main ring (MR) in the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). To address this issue, the decoherence and recoherence of the transverse motion of the particles comprising the proton bunch are investigated. The analysis reveals that the space charge effects have a significant influence on the recoherence period through the chromaticity. Nevertheless, the relationship between the maximum frequency in the bunch and the chromaticity is not affected by the space charge effects. These findings are demonstrated with particle tracking simulations including the direct and indirect space charge effects, and the impedance source of the J-PARC MR. Furthermore, we illustrate the influence of the indirect space charge effect on particle motion by examining the excitation patterns of radial and head-tail modes.",

    "title": "Controlling the recovery time of the superconducting nanowire   single-photon detector with a voltage-controlled cryogenic tunable resistor",
    "abstract": "Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD), owing to their unique performance, are currently the standard detector in most demanding single-photon experiments. One important metric for any single-photon detector is the deadtime (or recovery time), defined as the minimum temporal separation between consecutive detection events. In SNSPDs, the recovery time is more subtle, as the detection efficiency does not abruptly drop to zero when the temporal separation between detection events gets smaller, instead, it increases gradually as the SNSPD current recovers. SNSPD's recovery time is dominated by its kinetic inductance, the readout impedance, and the degree of saturation of internal efficiency. Decreasing the kinetic inductance or increasing the readout impedance can accelerate the recovery process. Significant reduction of the SNSPD recovery time, by, for example, adding a series resistor in the readout circuitry, is possible but can lead to detector latching which hinders further detector operation or enforces underbiasing and hence a reduction in detection efficiency. Previous research has demonstrated passive resistive networks for the reduction of recovery time that rely on trial and error to find the appropriate resistance values. Here we show, using a novel, cryogenically compatible, and tunable resistor technology, one can find the optimized impedance values, delivering fast SNSPD recovery time, while maintaining maximum internal detection efficiency. Here we show an increase of more than 2 folds in both maximum achievable detection rates and the achievable detection efficiency at high photon fluxes, demonstrating detection rates as high as 120 Mcps with no loss of internal detection efficiency.",

We present the design of an FPGA-based solution optimised for ND-GAr, which is part of the Phase-II more capable near detector for DUNE. These electronics reduce the cost significantly compared to using collider readout electronics which are typically designed for much higher occupancy and therefore, for example, need much larger numbers of FPGAs and power per channel. We demonstrate the performance of our electronics with the TOAD at Fermilab in the US at a range of pressures and gas mixtures up to 4.5barA, reading out ~10000 channels from a multi-wire proportional chamber. The operation took place between April and July of 2024. We measure the noise characteristics of the system to be sufficiently low and we identify sources of noise that can be further mitigated in the next iteration. We also note that the cooling scheme used in the test requires improvement before full-scale deployment. Despite these necessary improvements, we show that the system can fulfil the needs of a HPgTPC for a fraction of the price of collider readout electronics.",

    "abstract": "The Tokamak \\`a Configuration Variable (TCV) is equipped with an advanced set of diagnostics for studying suprathermal electron dynamics. Among these, the vertical electron cyclotron emission (VECE) diagnostic offers valuable insights into the electron energy distribution by measuring electron cyclotron emission (ECE) along a vertical line-of-sight. However, reconstructing the electron distribution from ECE measurements is inherently challenging due to harmonic overlap and thermal radiation noise. A more practical approach leverages forward modeling of ECE based on kinetic simulations. To this end, we introduce YODA, a novel synthetic ECE diagnostic framework that simulates emission and (re)absorption of electron cyclotron radiation for arbitrary electron distributions and antenna geometries. The framework is validated against the well-established synthetic ECE code SPECE, using an ohmic TCV discharge as a reference case. In this study, the 3D bounce-averaged Fokker-Planck code LUKE is used to model electron distributions in two electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) experiments. The synthetic spectra generated using the combined LUKE-YODA framework successfully reproduce the main features of the experimental VECE measurements in both simulated discharges. The combination of kinetic and synthetic ECE simulations allow the identification of the features in the electron distribution function which give rise to certain signatures in the VECE signal.",

    "title": "A machine learning approach to automation and uncertainty evaluation for   self-validating thermocouples",
    "abstract": "Thermocouples are in widespread use in industry, but they are particularly susceptible to calibration drift in harsh environments. Self-validating thermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell (fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the thermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a known melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes through the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits a \"plateau\" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is known, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting plateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but requires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the actual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the melting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning approach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting plateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins, along with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human intervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from test data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau detection.

    "abstract": "In this article, we present a detailed characterisation of a multicusp-assisted inductively coupled RF plasma source for plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). Using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and RF-compensated Langmuir probe diagnostics, we measured ion temperature T i and drift velocity v z in argon plasmas near an immersed electrode. The multicusp configuration enhances plasma density at low pressure, enabling stable operation down to 0.8 mTorr. Timeaveraged measurements show no detectable perturbation near the pulsed electrode, indicating full plasma recovery between high-voltage pulses. LIF-derived potential profiles match Riemann's presheath theory, and ion velocity distributions reveal acceleration consistent with sheath dynamics. These results support the use of LIF for steady-state characterisation of the bulk and presheath regions in PIII systems.",

    "abstract": "The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.",

    "title": "Electron Acceleration via Lower-Hybrid Drift Instability in   Astrophysical Plasmas: Dependence on Plasma Beta and Suprathermal Electron   Distributions",
    "abstract": "Density inhomogeneities are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, particularly at magnetic reconnection sites, shock fronts, and within compressible turbulence. The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous plasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma instabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably, lower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma environments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies have primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these regions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of LHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized media, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster plasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical settings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized by the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal electrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we determine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable efficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of instability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further analyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm these critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is generally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\\beta < 1$). However, the presence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration via LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\\beta > 1$). Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of LHDI in electron acceleration across diverse plasma environments.",

    "title": "The impact of kinetic and global effects on ballooning 2nd stable   pedestals of conventional and low aspect ratio tokamaks",
    "abstract": "The EPED model [P.B. Snyder et al 2011 Nucl. Fusion 51 103016] had success describing the pedestals of the Type-I ELM and QH-mode operations in conventional tokamaks, by combining kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) and peeling-ballooning (PB) constraints. Within EPED, the KBM constraint is usually approximated by the ideal ballooning mode (IBM) stability threshold. It has been noted that quantitative differences between local ideal MHD and gyro-kinetic (GK) ballooning stability can be larger at low aspect ratio. KBM critical pedestals are consistent with observations in initial studies on conventional and spherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the calculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on a novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M. Staebler et al 2023 Phys. Plasmas 30 102501]. GFS is observed to capture KBMs in DIII-D as well as the NSTX(-U) pedestals, opening a route integrating this model into EPED. Finally, high-n global ballooning modes are observed to limit the access to the local 2nd stability and thus provide a transport mechanism that constrains the width evolution with beta_p,ped. The high-n global ballooning stability is approximated by its ideal MHD analogue using ELITE. It is shown that nearly local high-n with k_y*rho_s~1/2 modes can provide a proxy for the critical beta_p,ped when a 2nd stable access exists on DIII-D plasmas. The use of GFS and ELITE scaling in EPED provided an improved agreement in comparison to EPED1 with DIII-D pedestal data.",

    "abstract": "The Self-Excited Loop (SEL) architecture, used in some continuous-wave (CW) superconducting linacs, relies on a positive feedback mechanism that requires carefully defined operating limits to ensure stable operation. These limits are typically derived from amplifier calibration, which characterizes the relationship between forward power and DAC drive. However, amplifier non-linearity often prevents a simple linear fit of this characteristic, introducing errors that can compromise stability. To address this, we present a modified calibration procedure that incorporates amplifier non-linearity into the SEL framework.

    "abstract": "In high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, particles can lose a substantial fraction of their energy by emitting radiation. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we study the impact of radiation reaction on the dynamics of an underdense plasma target struck by counterpropagating circularly polarized laser pulses. By varying the relative wavelengths and intensities of the pulses, we find a range of parameters where radiation reaction can detrap electrons from the interference beat wave. The resulting charge separation field and the dominant direction of ion expulsion are thus reversed by radiative effects. Based on the electron dynamics during the interaction, we estimate the bounds on the parameter regime where the reversal occurs. The bounds take the form of three simple inequalities which depend only on the wavelength, normalized vector potential, and pulse duration ratios of the two lasers as well as the product of the pulse duration with a dimensionless radiation reaction parameter. Our estimates, which predict whether radiation reaction will change the final ion direction for a given set of laser parameters, broadly agree with the simulated results. Finally, we outline an experimental procedure by which the reversal could be used to observe the transition to radiation-dominated dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We report on a new measurement of the energy resolution that can be attained in liquid xenon when recording only the scintillation light. Our setup is optimized to maximize light collection, and uses state-of-the-art, high-PDE, VUV-sensitive silicon photomultipliers. We find a value of 3.7 $\\pm$ 0.4% $\\sigma$ at 511 keV, once saturation effects are corrected for, a result close to the Poissonian resolution that we expect in our setup (2.8 $\\pm$ 0.4% $\\sigma$ at 511 keV). Our results in the intrinsic resolution (2.3 $\\pm$ 0.8 % $\\sigma$) are compatible, within errors, at 511 keV, with those found by theoretical estimations which have been standing for the last twenty years, 1.8% $\\sigma$. Our work opens new possibilities for apparatus based on liquid xenon and using scintillation only. In particular it suggests that modular scintillation detectors using liquid xenon can be very competitive as building blocks in segmented calorimeters, with applications to Positron Emission Tomography technology.",

    "abstract": "The BULLKID-DM experiment aims to detect WIMP-like potential Dark Matter particles with masses below 1 GeV/c^2. Sensing these particles is challenging, as it requires nuclear recoil detectors characterized by high exposure and an energy threshold in the order of 100 eV, thus exceeding the capabilities of conventional semiconductor detectors. BULLKID-DM intends to tackle this challenge by using cryogenic Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) with exceptional energy thresholds to sense a target with a total mass of 800 g across 16 wafers, divided into over 2000 individually instrumented silicon dice. The MKIDs on each wafer are coupled to a single transmission line and read using a frequency division multiplexing approach by the room-temperature data acquisition.   In this contribution, we describe and assess the design of the room-temperature readout electronics system, including the selected hardware components and the FPGA firmware which contains the real-time signal processing stages for tone generation, frequency demultiplexing, and event triggering. We evaluate the system on the ZCU216 board, a commercial evaluation card built around a Radio-Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) with integrated high-speed DACs and ADCs, and connected it to a custom-designed analog front-end for signal conditioning.",

    "abstract": "Traditional PID controllers have limited adaptability for plasma shape control, and task-specific reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from limited generalization and the need for repetitive retraining. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for developing a versatile, zero-shot control policy from a large-scale offline dataset of historical PID-controlled discharges. Our approach synergistically combines Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Hilbert space representation learning to achieve dual objectives: mimicking the stable operational style of the PID data and constructing a geometrically structured latent space for efficient, goal-directed control. The resulting foundation policy can be deployed for diverse trajectory tracking tasks in a zero-shot manner without any task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations on the HL-3 tokamak simulator demonstrate that the policy excels at precisely and stably tracking reference trajectories for key shape parameters across a range of plasma scenarios. This work presents a viable pathway toward developing highly flexible and data-efficient intelligent control systems for future fusion reactors.",

    "title": "Tilt-to-length noise subtraction with pointing jitters from closed-loop   dynamics for TianQin",
    "abstract": "TianQin is a proposed space-based mission for gravitational wave detection, employing a constellation of three drag-free satellites in high Earth orbits to form a laser interferometric observatory. A critical technical challenge is mitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the third dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise is unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites, movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be subtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients can be estimated from the null TDI channel $\\zeta$ and used for noise subtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA yaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of realistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC) are yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations to generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration capability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more favorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the accuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency data (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve estimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such as $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case of high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different sinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These methods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the TTL noise subtraction.",

    "title": "Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-P√©rot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter   Detection",
    "abstract": "Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\\gamma} \\gtrsim 3\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.",

    "title": "Activities of the Korea ALICE group for the development and production   of the next-generation silicon tracker",
    "abstract": "ALICE 3 is the proposed next-generation heavy-ion experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), envisioned for operation during Run 5. The tracking system of ALICE 3 will consist of a high-precision vertex detector integrated into a retractable structure inside the beam pipe, complemented by a large-area outer tracker covering a broad pseudorapidity range. Both systems will be based on the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) technology, building upon the developments realized for the recently upgraded ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS2) and the future ITS3 upgrade. The total silicon area of the ALICE 3 tracking system is expected to be approximately five times larger than that of ITS2, presenting significant challenges in terms of large-scale sensor testing and module production. To address these challenges, research and development activities have been initiated in Korea, including the adaptation of an automated die-attach machine, commonly used in the semiconductor packaging industry, for efficient sensor-to-substrate assembly. This contribution presents the ongoing efforts of the Korea ALICE group toward the development and production of the ALICE 3 silicon tracker. The scope includes sensor evaluation, automated assembly techniques, and prototype module construction, with the aim of establishing scalable procedures for future mass production.",

    "title": "Energy calibration of bulk events in the BULLKID detector",
    "abstract": "BULLKID is a cryogenic, solid-state detector designed for direct searches of particle Dark Matter candidates, with mass $\\lesssim 1$ GeV/c$^2$, and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. It is based on an array of dice carved in 5 mm thick silicon crystal, sensed by phonon-mediated Kinetic Inductance Detectors. In previous works, the array was calibrated with bursts of optical photons, which are absorbed in the first hundreds nanometers of the dice and give rise to surface events. In this work, we present the reconstruction of bulk events through the 59.5 keV $\\gamma$-ray generated by an $^{241}$Am source, which emulates more closely the interaction of Dark Matter and neutrinos. The peak resolution is $5\\%~(\\sigma)$ and its position is shifted by less than $10\\%$ with respect to the optical calibration. We observe that the resolution is further improved by a factor $2$ combining the signal from neighboring dice. These results confirm the performance of the detector in view of the physics goals of the BULLKID-DM experiment for dark matter search.",

    "title": "Laboratory and Synchrotron Validation of $Œº$-XRF for Sulfur Mapping in   CTMP Paper Samples",
    "abstract": "The transition toward renewable, fiber-based packaging requires an improved understanding of chemical modifications in high-yield pulps such as chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the energy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory methods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the fiber level, which can be visualized using $\\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present a laboratory $\\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its capability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets. A 32 $\\times$ 32 point grid scan (1.6-1.6 mm$^2$ field of view, 50 $\\mu$m step, 300 s/point) successfully resolved sulfur K$\\alpha$ (2.31 keV) and calcium K$\\alpha$ (3.69 keV) fluorescence without helium flushing. Comparative measurements at the Elettra synchrotron confirmed consistency of sulfur peak position and spatial distribution, with higher spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Histogram analysis using Wasserstein distance metrics demonstrated close agreement between datasets despite differing acquisition conditions. These results demonstrate that laboratory XRF can reproducibly detect and map sulfur in CTMP fibers under ambient conditions, providing a practical tool to complement synchrotron studies and supporting the development of energy-efficient, fiber-based packaging materials.",

    "abstract": "Optical lattices play a significant role in the field of cold atom physics, particularly in quantum simulations. Varying the lattice period is often a useful feature, but it presents the challenge of maintaining lattice phase stability in both stationary and varying-period regimes. Here, we report the realization of a low frequency feedback loop for a tunable optical lattice. Our scheme employs a CCD camera, a computer, and a piezoelectric actuator mounted on a mirror. Using this setup, we significantly improved the long-term stability of an optical lattice over durations exceeding 10 seconds. More importantly, we demonstrated a rapid change in the optical lattice period without any loss of phase. The developed phase stabilization algorithm can be extended to more complicated 2D latices, than just periodic lattice.",

To suppress these effects the storage ring will be equipped with a bunch-by-bunch feedback system. Important components of the feedback system are a stripline (fast) kicker and a beam position monitor.   The paper describes design of the low-impedance stripline kicker for SRF \"SKIF\" storage ring, optimized for the manufacturing and for the uniformity of the imparted transverse kick. The kicker qualities such as S-parameters, imparted transverse momentum, transfer and beam impedances are presented.

    "abstract": "The N$\\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy resolution through direct charge collection.   In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\\nu$DEx ion TPC. The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding values of $0.444 \\pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \\pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively.   The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an 10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on drift time differences and Breadth First search.   To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and sensitivity studies in the N$\\nu$DEx experiment.",

    "title": "Measurement of radon concentration in the output water of the 100~t/h   ultrapure water system at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory",
    "abstract": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purpose low background liquid scintillator detector, was proposed primarily to determine the neutrino mass ordering. To mitigate radioactivity from surrounding rock and enable cosmic muon tagging, its central detector is immersed in a Water Cherenkov Detector (WCD) containing 40~ktons of ultrapure water instrumented with 2400 20-inch micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes. Stringent radiopurity requirements mandate a radon concentration below 10 ~mBq/m$^3$ in the WCD. To achieve this, we developed a two-stage (ground and underground) ultrapure water system with 100~t/h production capacity, integrating a five-stage degassing membrane for radon removal. A novel microbubble technique was implemented to optimize the degassing membranes' radon removal efficiency. The synergistic combination of the microbubble technology and the multistage degassing membranes achieved a radon removal efficiency exceeding 99.9\\%, reducing the system's output to 0.61 $\\pm$ 0.50~mBq/m$^3$ in recirculation mode, surpassing design specifications and establishing world-leading performance standards. This paper details the ultrapure system architecture, quantifies the radon contributions of each device, and presents a comprehensive study on microbubble-augmented membrane degassing for low radon ultra-pure water production in a 100~t/h water system.",

    "title": "Space charge and ion transport in aerosol neutralization: Toward a   concentration-dependent alternative to the $N_it$ product",
    "abstract": "In this study, we quantify how charged particle concentration affects the neutralization rate of aerosol particles, focusing on the role of ion dynamics shaped by internal electric fields arising from net space charge. Conventional neutralizer performance is typically evaluated using the $N_it$ product, which assumes quasi-neutral conditions and neglects electric fields from small charge imbalances. We demonstrate that internal electric fields become increasingly important at high aerosol concentrations and significantly influence neutralization dynamics. We develop a coupled ion--aerosol transport model in a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that includes ion generation, convection, diffusion, recombination, attachment to aerosols, and wall loss, with self-consistent electric fields obtained from the Poisson equation. Results show that even small net charges generate electric fields that enhance ion drift and accelerate neutralization, effects not captured by traditional $N_it$-based approaches. Using a neutralization time metric, we find that neutralization becomes slower with increasing aerosol number concentration $N_p$, higher initial particle charge $q_0$, and smaller particle diameter $d_p$ when space charge is absent. When space charge is included, the influence of $q_0$ and $d_p$ diminishes, while $N_p$ becomes the dominant factor governing neutralization behavior. Accordingly, we propose a concentration-dependent analytical expression for mean charge relaxation that captures coupled ion--aerosol transport and space charge effects. The modeling framework presented here is applicable to laboratory instruments, industrial processes, and atmospheric environments where electrostatic interactions govern aerosol behavior.",

    "abstract": "Flying-focus wakefields, which can propagate with a tunable velocity along the optical axis, are promising solutions to electron dephasing in laser-wakefield accelerators. This is accomplished by a combination of spatio-temporal couplings and focusing with an axiparabola, a specialized optical element which produces a quasi-Bessel beam. If implemented, dephasingless acceleration would allow for a hitherto unachievable mixture of high acceleration gradients and long acceleration lengths. Here, we conduct an in-depth study of the structure and behavior of such a flying-focus wakefield, through a combination of direct imaging and simulations. We show the stability of the wakefield structures, explore how the wakefield evolves with changes of density, study the effects of ionization on the wakefield structure with a variety of gases, and analyze the importance of the focusing position. These insights shed light onto this novel wakefield regime and bring understanding that is important to the realization of dephasingless acceleration.",

    "abstract": "The ionization quenching factor, the fraction of an ion's initial kinetic energy lost through ionization in a medium, was measured for H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions within the 2.5-5 keV energy range in an Ar/CO$_2$ gas mixture at pressures between 75 and 150 mbar. The mixture was contained in the active volume of a MICROMEGAS type Micro Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD), which was connected to an ion source via a high vacuum system. The results showed a significant decrease in ionization as the ion energy decreased, although no dependence on gas pressure was observed within the low pressure range studied. Additionally, significant deviations from the predictions of SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) simulations were found. These measurements also allowed the first determination of $W$ values (the average energy required to create an electron-ion pair in the gas) for H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions in Ar at this particular energy range, which had not been previously explored for these projectile-target combinations. These findings are essential for accurate ion energy reconstruction in low-pressure MPGDs, with particular relevance for space-based energetic neutral atom detection, as proposed by the Italian Space Agency's SWEATERS project.",

    "abstract": "We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.3 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.6 to 1.5 ns in the single-photon regime with an intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, and also in pixel count and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and timewalk effect, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera's temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.",

    "title": "Readout of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) Arrays for   Habitable Worlds Observatory Using a Polyphase Filterbank Algorithm",
    "abstract": "The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a nextgeneration ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope, will require detector technologies capable of supporting substantially larger pixel-count arrays than those flown on previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) provide a scalable solution through microwave multiplexing and have already been demonstrated in balloon-borne instruments using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for real-time signal processing. A central element of MKID readout is the Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB) spectrometer, which converts digitized timedomain signals into finely resolved frequency channels for subsequent analysis. To meet the demands for broader bandwidths and higher spectral resolution driven by emerging science goals, efficient FPGA-based implementations of the PFB are essential. This work presents current results from a fixed-point digital design methodology for deploying the PFB architecture on spacequalified FPGAs. The approach emphasizes efficient resource utilization and numerical precision while satisfying stringent performance constraints, enabling scalable, high-resolution spectral processing for future space observatories and remote sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the use of extended phase-space symplectic integration [M. Tao, Phys. Rev. E 94, 043303 (2016)] for simulating two different classes of electron dynamics. The first one, with one and a half degrees of freedom, comes from plasma physics and describes the classical dynamics of a charged particle in a strong, constant, and uniform magnetic field perturbed by a turbulent electrostatic potential. The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations. Our work paves the way for broad application of symplectic split-operator integration of classical and quantum Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom.",

    "abstract": "We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\\ell/\\hbar=0,\\pm1,\\pm2,\\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\\rm kin}\\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\\rm kin}\\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.",

    "title": "Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Wave Excitation by Laser Pulse in a   Magnetized Plasma",
    "abstract": "In the study of plasma, particularly in applications involving strong laser-plasma interactions, the propagation of a strong electromagnetic wave induces relativistic velocities in the electron flow. Given such conditions, the wave propagating through the plasma experiences modulational instability. In this paper, we investigate this instability using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. In the relativistic limit, the motion of ions can be neglected due to their significant inertia, allowing us to treat the ions as a background fluid. This simplification enables us to apply perturbation techniques to the electron fluid equations, leading to the derivation of the nonlinear wave equation in the form of the Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Equation (NLSE). We also explore the relationship between wave dispersion and the conditions for instability. We derive the maximum growth rate of the modulational instability and analyze its dependence on plasma parameters and wave intensity in the context of relativistic magnetized plasma, providing quantitative insights into the instability dynamics. Finally, we examine aspects of the perturbed NLSE using the Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky perturbation approach, treating real and imaginary coefficients separately, which explicitly incorporates both Nonlinear Landau Damping (NLLD) and growth-damping effects.",

    "title": "A flexible and differentiable coil proxy for stellarator equilibrium   optimization",
    "abstract": "Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most present stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: the first for the equilibrium and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. It is challenging to find a compromise between plasma and coils with this approach. In recent years, single-stage approaches have gained popularity, which attempt to optimize both the plasma and coils simultaneously to improve the plasma-coil balance. In exchange, it can substantially increase the problem's dimensionality and introduce the ill-posedness of filamentary coil optimization to equilibrium optimization. This paper introduces a new ``quasi-single-stage'' method representing a flexible and differentiable coil proxy that directly predicts coil complexity during equilibrium optimization. The proxy is based on the adjoint differentiation of a winding surface coil subproblem. Our proxy can balance coil and plasma performance without introducing new degrees of freedom or ill-posedness. We present initial numerical results that demonstrate the proxy's effectiveness for single-stage optimization.",

    "abstract": "Kinetic simulations of relativistic gases and plasmas are critical for understanding diverse astrophysical and terrestrial systems, but the accurate construction of the relativistic Maxwellian, the Maxwell-J\\\"uttner (MJ) distribution, on a discrete simulation grid is challenging. Difficulties arise from the finite velocity bounds of the domain, which may not capture the entire distribution function, as well as errors introduced by projecting the function onto a discrete grid. Here we present a novel scheme for iteratively correcting the moments of the projected distribution applicable to all grid-based discretizations of the relativistic kinetic equation. In addition, we describe how to compute the needed nonlinear quantities, such as Lorentz boost factors, in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme through a combination of numerical quadrature and weak operations. The resulting method accurately captures the distribution function and ensures that the moments match the desired values to machine precision.",

    "abstract": "The scalability of most transition-edge sensor arrays is limited by the multiplexing technology which combines their signals over a reduced number of wires and amplifiers. In this Letter, we present and demonstrate a multiplexer design optimized for transition-edge sensor bolometers with 1820 sensors per readout unit, a factor of two more than the previous state-of-the-art. The design is optimized for cosmic microwave background imaging applications, and it builds on previous microwave superconducting quantum interference device multiplexers by doubling the available readout bandwidth to the full 4-8 GHz octave. Evaluating the key performance metrics of yield, sensitivity, and crosstalk through laboratory testing, we find an end-to-end operable detector yield of 78%, a typical nearest-neighbor crosstalk amplitude of ~0.4%, and a median white noise level of 83 pA/rtHz due to the multiplexer, corresponding to an estimated contribution of 4% to the total system noise for a ground-based cosmic microwave background telescope. Additionally, we identify a possible path toward reducing resonator loss for future designs with reduced noise. We expect these developments to alleviate the system complexity, cryogenic requirements, and cost of future large arrays of low temperature detectors.",

    "title": "Physics insights from a large-scale 2D UEDGE simulation database for   detachment control in KSTAR",
    "abstract": "A large-scale database of two-dimensional UEDGE simulations has been developed to study detachment physics in KSTAR and to support surrogate models for control applications. Nearly 70,000 steady-state solutions were generated, systematically scanning upstream density, input power, plasma current, impurity fraction, and anomalous transport coefficients, with magnetic and electric drifts across the magnetic field included. The database identifies robust detachment indicators, with strike-point electron temperature at detachment onset consistently Te around 3-4 eV, largely insensitive to upstream conditions. Scaling relations reveal weaker impurity sensitivity than one-dimensional models and show that heat flux widths follow Eich's scaling only for uniform, low D and Chi. Distinctive in-out divertor asymmetries are observed in KSTAR, differing qualitatively from DIII-D. Complementary time-dependent simulations quantify plasma response to gas puffing, with delays of 5-15 ms at the outer strike point and approximately 40 ms for the low-magnetic-field-side (LFS) radiation front. These dynamics are well captured by first-order-plus-dead-time (FOPDT) models and are consistent with experimentally observed detachment-control behavior in KSTAR [Gupta et al., submitted to Plasma Phys.

The radio frequency that creates the optical sidebands for CPT quickly switches between two magnetic sensitive transitions and the magnetic field is extrapolated from the difference of the center frequencies of the magnetic resonances. Light shifts and common drifts like collisional shifts can be suppressed through careful choice of measured resonances and we show the light shift reduction by more than a factor of 20 compared to excitation with circular polarized light.

    "abstract": "In wave propagation problems, finite difference methods implemented on staggered grids are commonly used to avoid checkerboard patterns and to improve accuracy in the approximation of short-wavelength components of the solutions. In this study, we develop a mimetic finite difference (MFD) method on staggered grids for transport operators with divergence-free advective field that is proven to be energy-preserving in wave problems. This method mimics some characteristics of the summation-by-parts (SBP) operators framework, in particular it preserves the divergence theorem at the discrete level. Its design is intended to be versatile and applicable to wave problems characterized by a divergence-free velocity. As an application, we consider the electrostatic shear Alfv\\'en waves (SAWs), appearing in the modeling of plasmas. These waves are solved in a magnetic field configuration recalling that of a tokamak device. The study of the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the SAWs shows the energy conservation of the discretization scheme, demonstrating the stability of the numerical solution.",
