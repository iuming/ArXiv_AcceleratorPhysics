  "title": "Upgrade to Fixed and Translating Scintillation-based Loss Detector System in the Fermilab Drift Tube Linac",
  "abstract": "The closed-off structure of the Fermilab Drift Tube Linac precludes a robust array of instrumentation from directly monitoring the H- beam that is accelerated from 750 keV to 116 MeV. To improve beam tuning and operational assessment of Drift Tube Linac performance, scintillator-based loss monitors were previously installed along the exterior of the first two accelerating cavities to assess low energy beam losses. Here we present a recent upgrade to the loss monitor system, including significant improvements in analog signal processing to address baseline-interfering noise; digitization of the signals to enable regular operational use and tuning; and a new remote operation upgrade of the translating loss monitor with precise positioning of the loss monitor along its nine-foot track. Data from the fixed and translating detectors collected under varying beam conditions validate the utility of the upgrade.",
