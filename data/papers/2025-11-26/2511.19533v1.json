  "title": "Experimental Demonstration of an On-Axis Laser Ranging Interferometer for Future Gravity Missions",
  "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate a novel interferometric architecture for next-generation gravity missions, featuring a laser ranging interferometer (LRI) that enables monoaxial transmission and reception of laser beams between two optical benches with a heterodyne frequency of 7.3 MHz. Active beam steering loops, utilizing differential wavefront sensing (DWS) signals, ensure co-alignment between the receiving (RX) beam and the transmitting (TX) beam. With spacecraft attitude jitter simulated by hexapod-driven rotations, the interferometric link achieves a pointing stability below 10 urad/$\\mathrm{\\sqrt{Hz}}$ in the frequency range between 2 mHz and 0.5 Hz, and the fluctuation of the TX beam's polarization state results in a reduction of 0.14\\% in the carrier-to-noise-density ratio over a 15-hour continuous measurement. Additionally, tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling is experimentally investigated using the periodic scanning of the hexapod. Experimental results show that the on-axis LRI enables the inter-spacecraft ranging measurements with nanometer accuracy, making it a potential candidate for future GRACE-like missions.",
