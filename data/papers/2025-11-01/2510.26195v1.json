  "title": "The IDEA detector concept for FCC-ee",
  "abstract": "The electron-positron stage of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) provides exciting opportunities that are enabled by next generation particle physics detectors. This contribution presents IDEA, a detector concept optimised for FCC-ee and composed of a vertex detector based on MAPS, a very light drift chamber, a silicon wrapper, a high resolution dual-readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, an HTS based superconducting solenoid, a dual-readout fibre calorimeter, and three layers of muon chambers embedded in the magnet flux return yoke. In particular, the physics requirements and the technical solutions chosen in the various sub-systems to address them are discussed. This is followed by a description of the detector R&D currently in progress, test-beam results, and the expected performance on some key physics benchmarks.",
