  "title": "Doping of a Borexino-like Liquid Scintillator with Tellurium-Diols",
  "abstract": "One of the most promising approaches for future neutrinoless double beta decay searches is to incorporate a candidate isotope into the liquid scintillator of a next-generation neutrino detector. In this study, a sample of the high-performance 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene-based liquid scintillator from the Borexino detector was loaded with different concentrations of Te-diols. Therefore,a novel and completely water-free synthesis in a non-acidic organic environment at room temperature was used. Key parameters of the loaded samples were analyzed and compared with those of the pure Borexino liquid. Both the emission spectrum and transmission remained nearly unchanged,even at high doping levels. The reduction in light yield was moderate, with approximately 8,400 photons emitted for a 1 MeV energy deposition by an electron at 1$\\%$ tellurium loading. The time profile of the light emission induced by alpha particles was also investigated, revealing that the scintillation response becomes significantly faster with increasing tellurium concentration.",
