  "title": "High-order Mie resonance and transient field enhancement in laser-driven   plasma nanoshells",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate substantial field enhancement in plasma nanoshells through high-order Mie resonances using combined Mie theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Optimal shell geometries yield approximately threefold electric field enhancement for 800 nm irradiation, with transient buildup times of tens of femtoseconds before plasma expansion disrupts resonance. Few-cycle pulses produce reduced enhancement due to insufficient resonance establishment. These findings enable optimized laser-plasma interactions for applications including diagnostics of laser-cluster interaction and energetic ion production from engineered core-shell targets, highlighting the critical role of temporal dynamics in nanoplasma resonances.",
