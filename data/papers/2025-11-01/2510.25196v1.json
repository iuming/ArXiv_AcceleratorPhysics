  "title": "Fast chaos indicator from auto-differentiation for dynamic aperture   optimization",
  "abstract": "Automatic differentiation provides an efficient means of computing derivatives of complex functions with machine precision, thereby enabling differentiable simulation. In this work, we propose the use of the norm of the tangent map, obtained from differentiable tracking of particle trajectories, as a computationally efficient indicator of chaotic behavior in phase space. In many cases, a one-turn or few-turn tangent map is sufficient for this purpose, significantly reducing the computational cost associated with dynamic aperture optimization. As an illustrative application, the proposed indicator is employed in the dynamic aperture optimization of an ALS-U lattice design.",
