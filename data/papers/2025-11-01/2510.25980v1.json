  "title": "MKS 390 Micro-Ion Gauge Performance After Exposure to High Pressures",
  "abstract": "In certain applications, pressure transducers may be exposed to high pressures either deliberately or accidentally, raising concerns about their functionality afterwards. We compared the performance of two MKS Granville-Phillips 390 Micro-Ion Gauges against each other, one that had been exposed to 10,000 Torr and the other had never been exposed to pressures above 1000 Torr. Our results show that the differences in the readings between the gauges were within the range of uncertainty specified by the manufacturer indicating negligible impact due to the exposure to high pressure. Additionally, the high pressure exposure did not compromise the leak integrity of the gauge.",
