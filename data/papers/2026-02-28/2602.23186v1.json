  "title": "The transient behavior of superconducting multi-cell accelerating cavities",
  "abstract": "We employ an equivalent-circuit model of a multi-cell cavity to explore its time-dependent behavior in order to understand differences between the multi-cell model and the commonly-used model of a single-cell resonator. Furthermore, we address tolerances that arise from manufacturing imperfections.",
