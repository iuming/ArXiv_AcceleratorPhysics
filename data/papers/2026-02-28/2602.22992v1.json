  "title": "Hard X-Ray Zernike-Type Phase-Contrast Imaging with a Two-Block Crystal System",
  "abstract": "A novel scheme for Zernike-type hard X-ray phase-contrast imaging is proposed. The scheme relies on X-ray dynamical diffraction in a two-block crystal system with parallel crystal plates of equal thickness. A phase shifter providing a $π/2$ phase shift is placed in the inter-block gap of the crystal system. The method operates in a scanning geometry. The proposed imaging setup is compact and does not require conventional focusing optics. Numerical simulations of phase-contrast image formation are performed.",
