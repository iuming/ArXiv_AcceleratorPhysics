    "title": "Operator Formalism for Laser-Plasma Wakefield Acceleration",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop an operator-based framework for laser--plasma wakefield acceleration (LPWA) in capillary discharges, providing a compact and systematic description of the coupled dynamics of laser fields and plasma response. The formalism employs key operators: the transverse modal operator $\\hat{K}$, the nonlinear plasma operator $\\hat{N}[Ψ]$, the plasma oscillation operator $\\hatΩ_p^{\\,2}$, and the ponderomotive source operator $\\hatα$, which together describe mode coupling, plasma oscillations, and nonlinear feedback induced by the ponderomotive force. In the linear regime, the system is characterized by invariant subspaces associated with stable modal structures, while nonlinear interactions break these invariances, leading to mode mixing and complex dynamics. The approach establishes a direct connection between LPWA and Hilbert-space operator theory, including the invariant subspace, providing a formal mathematical interpretation of energy transfer and wakefield formation. Furthermore, the operator formalism integrates with neural operator methods, allowing efficient approximation of $\\hat{N}$ and $\\hatα$ for reduced-order modeling and predictive control. This hybrid physics--AI framework offers a robust foundation for modeling, analysis, and optimization of high-intensity laser--plasma interactions in next-generation accelerator experiments.",

    "title": "Characterization of thin optical filters for high purity Cherenkov light readout from scintillating crystals",
    "abstract": "A hybrid dual-readout calorimeter concept, comprising both electromagnetic and hadronic sections, has recently been proposed to meet the performance requirements of experiments at future e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ colliders. The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\\sim 100~\\rm μm$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle. Conversely, two absorptive long-pass filters with cutoff wavelengths around 590~nm were found to block more than 99\\% of the scintillation light from PWO crystals, satisfying the calorimeter specifications.",

    "title": "Adaptive Optics-Enhanced Michelson Interferometer for Spectroscopy of Narrow-Band Light Sources",
    "abstract": "Adaptive optics enables the deployment of interferometer-based spectroscopy without the need for moving parts necessary for scanning the interferometer arms. Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging.",

    "title": "Performance Optimization and Characterization of 7-pad Resistive PICOSEC Micromegas Detectors",
    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive characterization of resistive PICOSEC Micromegas detector prototypes, tested under identical conditions, constant drift gap, field configurations, and photocathode at the CERN SPS H4 beam line. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of resistive layer technology in gaseous timing detectors, demonstrating that robustness can be improved without compromising the excellent timing performance of PICOSEC Micromegas. Different resistive architectures and values were explored to optimize stability and ensure reliable long-term operation in challenging experimental environments. The prototype with a 10MΩ resistive layer achieved the best overall performance, with a timing resolution of 22.900 {\\pm} 0.002 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.190 {\\pm} 0.003 mm, while charge sharing across multiple pads enabled combined timing resolutions below 28 ps. A lower-resistivity (200kΩ) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response. These studies benchmark the potential of resistive layers for gaseous timing detectors and provide a foundation for scalable designs with optimized timing and spatial resolution across diverse experimental applications.",

    "abstract": "We present the design and testing of a prototype multiplexing kinetic inductance detector (KID) readout electronics for the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) space mission. PRIMA is a Probe-class astrophysics mission concept that will answer fundamental questions about the formation of planetary systems, the co-evolution of stars and supermassive black holes in galaxies, and the rise of heavy elements and dust over cosmic time. The readout electronics for PRIMA must be compatible with operation at Earth-Sun L2 and capable of multiplexing more than 1000 detectors over 2.5 GHz bandwidth while consuming around 30 W per readout chain. The electronics must also be capable of switching between the two instruments, which have different readout bands: the hyperspectral imager (PRIMAger, 2.6-4.9 GHz) and the spectrometer (FIRESS, 0.4-2.4 GHz). The PRIMA readout electronics use high-heritage SpaceCube digital electronics with a build-to-print SpaceCube Mini v3.0 board using a radiation-tolerant Kintex KU060 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a custom high-speed digitizer board, along with RF electronics that provide filtering and power conditioning. We present the driving requirements for the system, as well as the hardware, firmware, software, and system-level design that meets those requirements.",

Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.",

A novel all-reflective optical setup, including an off-axis reflective axicon, enabled efficient acceleration at 0.2 Hz and guiding at repetition rates up to 3.3 Hz.

However, the use of broadband illumination (hundreds of wavelengths) unlocks also the targeting of tissue metabolism by exploiting the wide differential-redox peak of absorption of cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). For this purpose, we present here a novel, broadband (780-900nm), multi-distance NIRS system, called 2bNIRS. Compact and portable (20 x 30 x 40 cm3), 2bNIRS was validated using a dynamic, optical phantom con-taining blood and yeast, and benchmarked against a multi-wavelength time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) system. Validation confirmed its accuracy in tracking haemody-namic and metabolic changes, with superior oximetry performance achieved via our BRUNO algorithm, which integrates broadband spectral fitting with spatially-re-solved analysis. Preliminary in vivo, human applications demonstrated 2bNIRS ap-plicability to monitoring both muscle tissue, during arm cuff occlusions, and the brain, during frontal cortex activation.",

Simulations of the 1.5-cell photogun under the presently available RF gradient of ~45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge forces are weak, and the transverse emittance is dominated by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and cathode-region solenoid yields a robust emittance-stabilization regime with a final normalized emittance of ~3.2 pi mm mrad. To assess prospects for accelerating structured electron beams, we additionally model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The results show that multi-MeV acceleration suppresses free-space spreading and preserves the wave-packet's initial OAM structure, indicating that the test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.",

    "title": "Impact of local bunching factors in single-pass THz free electron lasers",
    "abstract": "In simulations for modern free-electron lasers (FEL), shot noise plays a crucial role. While it is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, shot noise is typically modeled using macroparticles, with their bunching factors corresponding to the bunching factors of the much larger number of electrons. For short-wavelength FELs, the macroparticles are assumed to be uniformly distributed on the scale of the resonant wavelength, since shot noise dominates the initial radiation - for instance, in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold at longer wavelengths, particularly in the THz range, where the bunch current profile is not uniform even within the length of the resonant wavelength. Instead, the current profile dominates the initial bunching factors, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than shot noise. The slice-based bunching factors and bunching phases are derived for Gaussian distributions and compared with shot noise under the assumption that the current within each slice remains constant. Using the THz FEL at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a case study, the influence of the current profile has been benchmarked through simulations under very low bunch charge, where the full number of electrons can be modeled using the Genesis1.3 code. Additional simulations with the nominal working parameters of PITZ THz FEL have been compared with experimental data, indicating better agreement when the actual current profile is taken into account.",

    "title": "Design and Performance Simulation of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter at EicC",
    "abstract": "The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a key detector component for precise electron and photon measurements in electron-ion collision experiments. At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector.",

    "title": "Depth-enhanced molecular imaging with two-photon oblique plane microscopy",
    "abstract": "High-numerical-aperture (NA) oblique plane microscopy enables noninvasive fluorescence imaging of subcellular dynamics without requiring radical sample modification. However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\\sim\\!300$ nm lateral and $\\sim\\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo. Compared with two-photon point scanning, the lower illumination NA delivers an order of magnitude lower peak intensity, enabling $>\\!5\\times$ faster volumetric acquisition (up to $3.25 \\times 10^6$ voxels s$^{-1}$) with reduced photodamage. In multicellular contexts, near-infrared nonlinear excitation enhances contrast throughout the illumination depth by $\\sim\\!2\\times$ and restores volumetric resolving power by $>\\!2\\times$ relative to linear excitation. We demonstrate these capabilities through molecular imaging of epithelial tissue, stem-cell-derived gastruloids, and living fruit fly embryos, including multicolor transcription-factor dynamics, optogenetic subcellular control, and single-mRNA tracking, all using standard glass-based mounting.",

    "title": "Magnetic Centrifuge Effects in Ultrafast Laser Ablation Plasmas",
    "abstract": "A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with effective rotation rates on the order of $10^9$ radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field $B_{eff}$ is extracted for Ni isotopes which is shown to be a combination of an axial $B_z$ component and a second contribution $B_{ibw}$ that represents the equivalent of an effective magnetic field contributing to the isotopic separation due to broad spectrum Ion Bernstein Waves providing electrostatic acceleration to the cyclotron orbits. These IBWs are also responsible for a profound resonance of enrichment observed for certain specific charge states. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotation and IBWs dominate the process.",

    "abstract": "The combination of low temperature and low vibration levels is key for ultrasensitive sensing applications such as scanning probe microscopy, large-mass quantum mechanics, and gravitational wave detection. Unfortunately, closed-cycle cryostats using pulse tube or GM coolers introduce strong low-frequency vibrations starting at 1 Hz. Mass-spring systems allow passive isolation, but for low-frequency applications the required spring constants and masses become impractical. Blade-based geometric anti-spring systems are compact isolators that operate from sub-Hz frequencies, but have not been demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we characterize a geometric anti-spring system tuned to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Our cryogenic filter uses radially arranged titanium blade springs whose effective spring constant can be tuned in-situ using a magnetic actuator. Our system achieves a vertical resonance frequency of 185 mHz at 7K, which allows reduction of vibrations at the problematic 1 Hz cooler frequency by an order of magnitude.",

    "title": "Integrating High Performance In-Memory Data Streaming and In-Situ Visualization in Hybrid MPI+OpenMP PIC MC Simulations Towards Exascale",
    "abstract": "Efficient simulation of complex plasma dynamics is crucial for advancing fusion energy research. Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide insights into plasma behavior, including turbulence and confinement, which are essential for optimizing fusion reactor performance. Transitioning to exascale simulations introduces significant challenges, with traditional file input/output (I/O) inefficiencies remaining a key bottleneck. This work advances BIT1, an electrostatic PIC MC code, by improving the particle mover with OpenMP task-based parallelism, integrating the openPMD streaming API, and enabling in-memory data streaming with ADIOS2's Sustainable Staging Transport (SST) engine to enhance I/O performance, computational efficiency, and system storage utilization. We employ profiling tools such as gprof, perf, IPM and Darshan, which provide insights into computation, communication, and I/O operations. We implement time-dependent data checkpointing with the openPMD API enabling seamless data movement and in-situ visualization for real-time analysis without interrupting the simulation. We demonstrate improvements in simulation runtime, data accessibility and real-time insights by comparing traditional file I/O with the ADIOS2 BP4 and SST backends. The proposed hybrid BIT1 openPMD SST enhancement introduces a new paradigm for real-time scientific discovery in plasma simulations, enabling faster insights and more efficient use of exascale computing resources.",

    "abstract": "We derive a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck formula for the entropy of a dense fermion system with strong two-particle correlations, including scattering states and bound states. We work within the $Φ-$derivable approach to the thermodynamic potential. The formula takes the form of an energy-momentum integral over a statistical distribution function times a unique spectral density. In the near mass-shell limit, the spectral density reduces, contrary to naïve expectations, not to a Lorentzian but rather to a \"squared Lorentzian\" shape. The relation of the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula to the $Φ$-derivable approach is exact at the two-loop level for $Φ$. The formalism we develop, which extends the Beth-Uhlenbeck approach beyond the low-density limit, includes Mott dissociation of bound states, in accordance with Levinson's theorem, and the self-consistent back reaction of correlations in the fermion propagation. We discuss applications to further systems, such as quark matter and nuclear matter.",

    "abstract": "The low frequency electrostatic perturbations have been investigated in a bi ion plasma in the background of static dust. It is shown that the field aligned shear flow of both the ions produce low frequency electrostatic instabilities and create nonlinear structures, the double layers and the solitons. The general theoretical model is applied to the magnetospheres of Jupiter (with positively charged dust) and Saturn (with negatively charged dust) which have oxygen ions in addition to protons. This model predicts the existence of extremely low frequency electrostatic waves with real frequencies of the order of a milli Hertz (mHz) to several mHz and this range of frequencies have been reported in literature for these plasma environments. The estimated width of the nonlinear structures vary from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers. These structures are similar to that observed in the oxygen and oxygen hydrogen plasmas in Earth's upper ionosphere which is free from dust.",

    "title": "First Experimental Demonstration of Machine Learning-Based Tuning on the PSI Injector 2 Cyclotron",
    "abstract": "Reliable operation of high-power proton cyclotrons is a critical requirement for Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) and other large-scale applications. Beam tuning in such machines is traditionally performed manually, a process that can be slow, non-optimal, and difficult to execute in the presence of faults or changing conditions. To address this, we developed and deployed a machine learning (ML) based tuning framework on the Injector 2 cyclotron at PSI, chosen as an ideal testbed for high-power operation. The system combined a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm with real-time diagnostics and control, and incorporated accelerator-physics inspired adaptations such as an overshoot strategy that reduced magnetic field settling times by nearly a factor of six. Over an extensive 12-day operational test campaign, relatively long in the context of real-time ML experiments, the ML agent successfully tuned the machine across multiple operating points, achieving convergence within hours and maintaining stable beam extraction with reduced losses. Beyond initial tuning, the system was also operated in evaluation mode overnight, where it autonomously monitored and corrected the machine to compensate for drifts, demonstrating robustness and long-term stability. Crucially, the learned policy generalized reliably from low-current training to higher-current operation, underscoring its scalability. These results constitute the first demonstration of ML-assisted tuning on a high-power cyclotron, with direct relevance to ADS-class drivers.",

It uses curved mosaic crystals and motorized positioning stages to perform wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) with sub-10~eV tunable resolution for extended and dilute samples. Recent developments include the integration of an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) line based on a silicon pin-diode detector, which enables flux monitoring and simultaneous ED and WD measurements. In addition, a dedicated liquid-sample holder has been introduced, and a Y-shaped support geometry, crucial for switching to a transmission layout, provides mechanical compatibility with laboratory XAS, now under implementation. These upgrades expand the versatility and automation of VOXES, strengthening its role as a table-top platform for laboratory X-ray spectroscopy.",

    "title": "The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries",
    "abstract": "Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.",

    "abstract": "Data collected over a two-day period in June 2024 at the CERN SPS H9 test beam using a small-scale GRAiNITA prototype have been analyzed to characterize the detector's energy resolution performance. The measurements allow for a first estimate of the constant term associated with detector non-uniformity. Although the evaluation is limited by the small prototype size and the use of pion beams, the results indicate that the non-uniformity-related constant term is significantly below 1%. Furthermore, the test-beam data confirm that the contribution to the energy resolution arising from photo-electron statistics is approximately 1%/sqrt(E). These findings validate the expected calorimetric performance of the GRAiNITA concept and provide important input for the design and optimization of future full-scale detectors.",

A major challenge is the development of ultra-low-loss, high-optical-quality single-crystal diamond substrates to meet growing demands for quantum coherence and power handling. Traditionally, dielectric losses ($\\tan δ$) in diamonds are evaluated using Fabry-Perot microwave resonators, in which the resonance quality factors Q of the cavity with and without the sample are compared. These devices are limited to resolutions around 10$^{-5}$ by the need to keep the resonator dimensions within a reasonable range. In contrast, superconducting thin-film micro-strip resonators, with Q factors exceeding 10$^6$, are stated to provide higher sensitivity for assessing ultra-low-loss materials. This study examines four diamond samples grown through different processes, analyzing their dielectric losses at extreme low temperatures (sub-Kelvin) within the Two-Level System (TLS) framework. Complementary Raman spectroscopy measurements allowed us not only to associate higher nitrogen content with increased losses, but also to investigate how the different growth process influence the way these defects are incorporated in the crystal lattice.",

    "title": "First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal for low energy dark matter search",
    "abstract": "The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising, also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors have been the standard in Cosmic Microwave Background experiments for almost two decades and are now being adapted for use in nuclear physics, such as neutrinoless double beta decay searches. In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency multiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy resolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept to a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout SQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful consideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency multiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly designed frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a noise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID coil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output wiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a SQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic impedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as possible. Alternatively, the option of adding a cryogenic low-noise amplifier at the output of the SQUID should be explored.",

    "title": "Quasi-linear theory of perpendicular ion heating by critically balanced turbulence",
    "abstract": "In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfvénic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfvénic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations.",

    "title": "Subgrid Mean-field Dynamo Model with Dynamical Quenching in General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations",
    "abstract": "Large-scale magnetic fields are relevant for a number of dynamical processes in accretion disks, including driving turbulence, reconnection events, and launching outflows. Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $α_\\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $α_\\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $α_\\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields.",

A giga-gauss magnetic field is generated and amplified with the opposite polarity to the seed magnetic field. The spot size of the field is comparable to the laser wavelength, and the lifetime is hundreds of femtoseconds. An analytical model is presented to explain the underlying physics.

    "abstract": "Microbubble implosion (MBI) is a recently proposed novel mechanism with many interesting and exciting potential applications. MBI predicts that the inner layers of a spherical target with a hollow cavity can be compressed into a core with a density 105 times that of the solid density. Furthermore, this ultra-compressed core mostly consists of ions. This leads to the generation of ultra-high electric fields, which may be applicable to gamma-ray lensing or pair creation. However, MBI has yet to be studied for finite hollow spheres whose electrons are free to redistribute themselves after being given an initial temperature. This paper studies MBI under finite sphere conditions. Using an elec- tron distribution model, the electron distribution after receiving an initial temperature is studied. Then, the optimal parameters required to fill a hollow cavity with electrons are calculated. The dynamics of MBI is simulated using a hybrid one-dimensional code. The simulation demonstrates that MBI occurs even for finite spheres, and high-density compression is still achievable with this setup. It also shows the opti- mal target structure, which maximizes ion flashing.",

    "title": "Understanding cold electron impact on parallel-propagating whistler chorus waves via moment-based quasilinear theory",
    "abstract": "Earth's magnetosphere hosts a wide range of collisionless particle populations that interact through various wave-particle processes. Among these, cold electrons, with energies below 100eV, often dominate the plasma density but remain poorly characterized due to measurement challenges such as spacecraft charging and photoelectron contamination. Understanding the contribution of these cold populations to wave-particle interaction is of significant interest. Recent kinetic simulations identified a secondary drift-driven instability in which parallel-propagating whistler-mode chorus waves excite oblique electrostatic whistler waves near the resonance cone and Bernstein-mode turbulence. These secondary modes enable a new channel of energy transfer from the parallel-propagating whistler wave to the cold electrons. In this work, we develop a moment-based quasilinear theory of the secondary instabilities to quantify such energy exchange. Our results show that these secondary instabilities persist for a wide range of parameters and, in many cases, lead to nearly complete damping of the primary wave. Such secondary instability might limit the amplitude of parallel-propagating whistler waves in Earth's magnetosphere and might explain why high-amplitude oblique whistler or electron Bernstein waves are rarely observed simultaneously with high-amplitude field-aligned whistler waves in the inner magnetosphere.",

    "abstract": "The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will operate at high luminosity with multi-GeV, high-current electron beams, resulting in substantial synchrotron radiation (SR) emission in the electron storage ring (ESR). A detailed understanding of SR photon transport in the complex three-dimensional interaction region (IR) geometry is critical for estimating backgrounds in the ePIC detector and for developing effective shielding and masking strategies.   This paper presents SynradG4, an EIC-specific extension of Geant4 designed for fast photon tracking in vacuum using established SR reflection and rough surface scattering models. SynradG4 integrates the photon reflection models of Synrad+ within the Geant4 geometry and field framework, while disabling all bulk matter interactions to achieve high-statistics transport through the 50-m-long IR vacuum system. Absorbed photon coordinates are then passed to a second-stage DD4hep simulation, where full electromagnetic processes such as photoabsorption, Compton scattering, Rayleigh scattering, and fluorescence are enabled for propagation through the beam pipe and detector materials.   SynradG4 is not intended to replace general SR simulation codes; rather, it complements them by providing the workflow and geometry integration capabilities needed for EIC-specific background studies. Benchmark tests against Synrad+, Synrad3D, and the native Geant4 X-ray reflection model demonstrate excellent agreement for specular and diffuse reflection regimes. Using the full IR geometry and machine lattice, we present the first SR background estimates for the ePIC detector and evaluate the impact of potential SR masks.",

    "title": "Kaleidoscopic Scintillation Event Imaging",
    "abstract": "Scintillators are transparent materials that interact with high-energy particles and emit visible light as a result. They are used in state of the art methods of measuring high-energy particles and radiation sources. Most existing methods use fast single-pixel detectors to detect and time scintillation events. Cameras provide spatial resolution but can only capture an average over many events, making it difficult to image the events associated with an individual particle. Emerging single-photon avalanche diode cameras combine speed and spatial resolution to enable capturing images of individual events. This allows us to use machine vision techniques to analyze events, enabling new types of detectors. The main challenge is the very low brightness of the events. Techniques have to work with a very limited number of photons.   We propose a kaleidoscopic scintillator to increase light collection in a single-photon camera while preserving the event's spatial information. The kaleidoscopic geometry creates mirror reflections of the event in known locations for a given event location that are captured by the camera. We introduce theory for imaging an event in a kaleidoscopic scintillator and an algorithm to estimate the event's 3D position. We find that the kaleidoscopic scintillator design provides sufficient light collection to perform high-resolution event measurements for advanced radiation imaging techniques using a commercial CMOS single-photon camera.

    "title": "Energetic-particle orbits near rational flux surfaces in stellarators: I. Passing particles",
    "abstract": "Recent simulations have shown that, even when the magnetic field of a stellarator possesses nested toroidal flux surfaces, the orbits of passing energetic particles can exhibit islands. These 'drift islands' arise near rational flux surfaces, where they are likely to enhance alpha-particle transport -- flattening the alpha density profile locally -- unless they can be avoided by suitable design of the stellarator magnetic field. To investigate how this might be achieved, we derive an equation for the drift-island shape in a general stellarator. This result follows from the solution to a more fundamental problem: that of calculating the orbits of passing particles near a rational flux surface. We show that these orbits are determined by conservation of an adiabatic invariant associated with the closed rational-surface field lines. We use this 'transit adiabatic invariant' to prove that there are no drift islands, for all passing particles, if and only if the magnetic field satisfies a weaker version of the Cary-Shasharina condition for omnigeneity; we call such magnetic fields 'cyclometric'. The drift-island width scales as $\\sim (ρ_\\starδ/s)^{1/2} a$ ($ρ_\\star$ is the normalized gyroradius, $δ$ is the deviation from cyclometry, $s$ is the magnetic shear, and $a$ is the minor radius), so large drift islands could arise in low-shear stellarators that are insufficiently cyclometric. To ensure accurate results for very energetic particles, we compute higher-order corrections to the transit invariant. Our calculations agree extremely well with ASCOT5 guiding-centre and full-orbit simulations of alpha particles in reactor-scale equilibria, even at $3.5\\text{MeV}$. Finally, we show how our results can also be derived using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, which provides a systematic framework for calculating passing-particle orbits on both rational and irrational surfaces.",

In addition, the low noise signal source and controlled electronics provide ultralow phase-noise and dynamically tunable polarization. Narrow-band filters within the MW circuitry further reduce phase-noise by more than 20 dB at 20 MHz offset frequency, ensuring prolonged one-body molecular lifetimes up to 10 seconds. We also show practical methods to measure the MW field strength and polarization using a simple homemade dipole probe, and to characterize phase-noise down to -170 dBc/Hz with a commercial spectrum analyser and a notch filter. Those capabilities allowed us to evaporatively cool our molecular sample to deep quantum degeneracy. Furthermore, the polarization tunability enabled the observation of field-linked resonances and facilitated the creation of field-linked tetramers.These techniques advance the study of ultracold polar molecules and broaden the potential applications of MW tools in other platforms of quantum sciences.",

    "title": "IOTA Experiment for Proton Pulse Compression at Extreme Space-Charge",
    "abstract": "The longitudinal compression of high-intensity, space-charge-dominated proton bunches is a critical requirement for future proton-driven muon colliders. We propose a proton bunch compression experiment at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring at Fermilab to investigate optimal radio-frequency (RF) cavity parameters and lattice configurations. IOTA is a compact, fixed-energy storage ring dedicated to beam physics Research and Development and capable of circulating a 2.5 MeV proton beam under extreme space-charge conditions. Using the ImpactX code with its 3D space-charge solver, simulations indicate that the bunch length can be rapidly reduced by at least a factor of two without appreciable degradation of transverse beam quality--even in the strong space-charge regime. However, longitudinal defocusing due to the space-charge remains a significant challenge in short-pulsed intense proton bunches, and the optimization of compression under these conditions is discussed.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive characterization of the LAPPD Gen-II, a large-area microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) equipped with a capacitively coupled sensing (readout) electrode. Two detector variants with different geometries and materials were investigated using a picosecond pulsed laser system. We measured the single-photon timing response and spatial charge distribution on segmented readout electrodes. The prompt timing peak exhibits a resolution of approximately 30 ps, with the overall timing structure explained by photoelectron propagation and back-scattering effects from the MCP input surface. We developed analytical models that describe the propagation of photoelectrons and the induced charge spread on the sensing electrodes, including secondary electron backscattering from the resistive anode. The model accurately reproduces the measured device properties and enables performance extrapolations for various detector geometries and dielectric properties. These results provide a predictive framework for optimizing MCP-PMTs for timing- and imaging-critical applications such as RICH detectors in high-energy physics and TOF-PET systems for medical imaging.",

    "title": "Discovery and rectification of an error in high resistance traceability at NPL: a case study in how metrology works",
    "abstract": "We broach a seldom-discussed topic in precision metrology; how subtle errors in calibration processes are discovered and remedied. We examine a case study at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, involving the calibration of DC standard resistors of value 100 MOhm and 1 GOhm. Results from the period 2001 to 2015 were in error by approximately 0.7 parts per million (ppm), with quoted uncertainties (k=2) of 0.4 ppm and 1.6 ppm respectively. Inter-comparisons did not detect the error, mainly because the uncertainty due to the transportation drift of the comparison standards was too large to resolve it. Likewise, research into single-electron current standards did not detect the error because at this resistance value it was on the borderline of statistical significance. The key event was a comparison between PTB (Germany) and NPL (UK) of a new small-current measuring instrument, the ultrastable low-noise current amplifier (ULCA). At that time, the transport stability of the ULCA was not well established. Nevertheless, calibrations of the ULCA at NPL using a 100 MOhm resistor were sufficiently discrepant with the PTB calibrations to motivate a thorough investigation into the NPL traceability chain, which uncovered the error. This instructive episode illustrates a positive interplay between calibration and research activities and shows that cutting-edge calibration uncertainties must be supported by a vigorous research programme. It is also important for NMIs to maintain a comfortable buffer (at least a factor of 10) between their claimed uncertainty and the uncertainty that their customers require, so that small errors can be resolved without significant impact on measurement stakeholders.",

    "title": "Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI: Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks",
    "abstract": "The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.",

    "abstract": "Qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) simulations are performed for a two-dimensional (2D) spatially bounded pulse propagating onto a plane interface between two dielectric slabs. QLA is an initial value scheme that consists of a sequence of unitary collision and streaming operators, with appropriate potential operators, that recover Maxwell equations in inhomogeneous dielectric media to second order in the lattice discreteness. For the case of total internal reflection, there is transient energy transfer into the second medium due to the evanescent fields as the Poynting unit vector of the pulse is rotated from its incident to reflected direction. Because of the finite spatial extent of the pulse, a self-consistent Goos-Hanchen-type displacement along the interface is found without imposing any explicit interface boundary conditions on the fields. For normal incidence. the standard Fresnel coefficients are recovered for appropriately averaged QLA fields. Energy is conserved at all times to seven significant figures.",

    "abstract": "Single-photon sensitive detectors like Silicon Photomultipliers are widely used in many medical imaging applications. By using detectors with position resolutions, it is possible to build compact photodetector readouts with reduced number of channels, but still preserving position resolution and gamma-rays imaging capabilities. In this work, we present the advantage of using a Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) light position reconstruction applied to a 2x2 array of linearly-graded SiPMs (LG-SiPMs), to minimize the distortions on the reconstructed event maps. Our approach significantly enhances both the resolution and linearity of position detection compared to the nominal reconstruction formula based on the device architecture. Remarkably, the DNN-based reconstruction boosts the number of resolved areas (pixels) by a factor of at least 5.7, allowing a higher level of precision and performance in light detection.",

    "abstract": "Kaonic atoms, formed when a negatively charged kaon replaces an electron, provide a sensitive probe of the low-energy strong interaction via precision X-ray spectroscopy. The SIDDHARTA-2 experiment at the DA$Φ$NE collider employs high-performance Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) optimized for the 4-12 keV range to study light kaonic systems. In preparation for the EXKALIBUR phase, which targets heavier kaonic atoms, new 1 mm-thick SDDs have been developed with Politecnico di Milano and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. Their increased thickness enhances the quantum efficiency by a factor of about two at 30 keV while preserving excellent energy resolution. These detectors are also intended for VIP-3, the next-generation test of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP). Building on VIP-2, which set the most stringent limits on PEP-violating $K_α$ transitions in copper, VIP-3 will extend the search to heavier elements such as Ag, Sn, and Zr. Preliminary measurements demonstrate efficient detection up to 30 keV, supporting future high-precision studies of the kaon-nucleon interaction and PEP in heavier systems.",

In this work, we report the results of a calibration campaign performed with the collider operating, aimed at assessing the detector performance. A dedicated setup, including an array of quasi-hemispherical CZT sensors and a $^{152}$Eu source, was used to characterize the spectral response. The reconstructed emission lines were fitted with a model accounting for Gaussian response and incomplete charge recollection tails, and the detector linearity was evaluated by comparing the measured peak positions with their nominal energies.

    "abstract": "Photoionization plays a crucial role in achieving accurate quantitative predictions in SF6 streamer simulations, but accurate models for SF6 photoionization remains limited, motivating this paper. First, we develop a computational model for SF6 photoionization and provide the detailed theoretical modeling process, as well as comparison between experiment and simulation. A concise summary of model parameters within the comprehensive pressure range of 1 - 15 atm is provided for direct reference. Then, we perform comparative studies against simplified approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures the non-local effects of SF6 photoionization, enhancing both the spatial numerical convergence and the accuracy of the streamer structure. Finally, we perform comparative studies by artificially increasing the photoionization intensity through multiplying the photoionization source term Sph by a factor of 50 (50*Sph) relative to the baseline intensity. Regarding breakdown voltage prediction, 50*Sph leads to a significant underestimation of the breakdown voltage for positive streamers, introducing errors greater than 0.5 kV, while exerting a small impact on negative streamers. Regarding streamer propagation dynamics, the radius of the positive streamer head exhibits pronounced shrinking, and 50*Sph reduces this shrinking and significantly lowers the head field by more than 700 Td. In contrast, 50*Sph has little impact on the morphology of the negative streamers and slightly enhances the head field by less than 30 Td.",

    "abstract": "The detailed theoretical and numerical investigation of hybrid laser plasma RF accelerators, elucidating the mechanisms governing transverse beam dynamics, betatron polarization, and radiation reaction in ultra-relativistic electron bunches is presented. This framework combines analytical models of spatiotemporal plasma wakefield modulation, phase-dependent RF-driven oscillations, and quantum-corrected Landau Lifshitz radiation reaction with fully self-consistent 3D particle in cell simulations using EPOCH. The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate γ growth rates. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of nonlinear, resonant, and damping phenomena in hybrid laser plasma RF systems, highlighting the full spectrum of controllable transverse, longitudinal, and polarization dynamics in ultra relativistic electron beams.",
