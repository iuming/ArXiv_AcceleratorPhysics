  "title": "Mu2e Straw Tube Tracker Gas Flow Quality Control",
  "abstract": "We present a tracker gas flow quality control method developed for the Mu2e straw tube tracker. Using time-dependent current measurements, we quantify the onset time of ionization gain induced by an 55Fe source during gas exchange, which is correlated to the gas conductance in the straw. This allows for the identification of channels with inadequate flow. This approach is broadly applicable to other gaseous detectors that require high-channel-count screening.",
