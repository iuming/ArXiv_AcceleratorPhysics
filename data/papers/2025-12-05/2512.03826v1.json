  "title": "Recent Developments of the VOXES Von Hamos X-ray Spectrometer for Laboratory XES and XAS Studies",
  "abstract": "VOXES is a Von Hamos X-ray spectrometer developed at the INFN National Laboratories of Frascati for high-resolution laboratory X-ray spectroscopy in the 5--20~keV range. It uses curved mosaic crystals and motorized positioning stages to perform wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) with sub-10~eV tunable resolution for extended and dilute samples. Recent developments include the integration of an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) line based on a silicon pin-diode detector, which enables flux monitoring and simultaneous ED and WD measurements. In addition, a dedicated liquid-sample holder has been introduced, and a Y-shaped support geometry, crucial for switching to a transmission layout, provides mechanical compatibility with laboratory XAS, now under implementation. These upgrades expand the versatility and automation of VOXES, strengthening its role as a table-top platform for laboratory X-ray spectroscopy.",
