  "title": "Density of hybrid plasma generated by microwave and laser radiation in the Ar:H2:CH4 mixture",
  "abstract": "The atmospheric-pressure hybrid plasma in the Ar:H2:CH4 mixture, maintained by microwave radiation (2.47 GHz) and CO2 laser radiation (10.6 μm) in the chamber of an experimental plasma-chemical reactor designed to study the synthesis of diamond-like coatings was studied. The electron number density was determined from the Stark broadening of the Hα line shape of atomic hydrogen. It was shown that when laser radiation is focused in the region of a microwave plasma bunch, the Hα line shape in the hybrid plasma spectra has broad wings and is described by a Lorentz function with a two-contour approximation. The complex structure of the Hα line profile of the hybrid plasma indicates its spatiotemporal inhomogeneity. The electron number density corresponding to the contour with a smaller half-width exceeds the electron number density in microwave plasma and lies in the range of (4-8)E15 cm-3, and the electron number density measured by the contour with a larger half-width is (1.5-2)E17 cm-3.",
