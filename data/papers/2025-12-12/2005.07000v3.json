  "title": "A telecommunications system based on axion dark matter coherent transmission",
  "abstract": "In this manuscript we anticipate axion detection in order to theorize on a novel telecommunications system based on the coherent axion-two-photon vertex Primakoff effect conversion and reversion of microwave photons transmitting a modulated signal. We suggest a possible set-up for an experiment or industrial application using state-of-the-art technology and we estimate the output power and photon rate expected to be received as a function of the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{aγγ}$. We find that, although challenging,this system has no physical restriction to render it unfeasible. Finally, we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of a hypothetical axion-based telecommunications system compared to traditional telecommunication systems. We then extend the discussion, noting the more important conclusions.",
