  "title": "Electron Recoil via Sample Momentum Transfer under Optical-Mode Excitation",
  "abstract": "The interaction between free electrons and optical modes underlies a variety of quantum and nanoscale light-matter phenomena, yet the associated momentum exchange with the sample largely remained overlooked. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the momentum transfer from free electrons to planar samples during optical mode excitation using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The momentum transfer to the sample modifies the apparent dispersion relation which is significant when the planner sample is tilted. Under specific conditions, the sample receives momentum opposite to the electron beam direction.",
