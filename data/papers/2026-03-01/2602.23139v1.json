  "title": "Charge collection parameterization of MALTA2, a depleted monolithic active pixel sensor",
  "abstract": "A fast simulation method is presented for a depleted monolithic active pixel sensor, which uses a data driven parameterization of the charge collection and propagation. This approach provides an efficient alternative to TCAD simulations, particularly for sensors whose proprietary process details - such as doping profiles or implant geometries - are unavailable. Data was obtained with a MALTA2 sensor fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS imaging technology on 30 μm epitaxial silicon using the MALTA beam telescope at CERN SPS. The model reproduces the measured inpixel efficiency with high accuracy and enables a realistic yet computationally lightweight analog pixel simulation. This method will be further employed in optimizing the digital sensor design for applications in high-rate particle tracking and high-granularity calorimetry.",
