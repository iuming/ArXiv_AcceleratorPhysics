  "title": "Unstable magnetic reconnection self-generates turbulence",
  "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are deeply intertwined in magnetohydrodynamic flows, yet how reconnection self-generates turbulence remains unclear. Using an ensemble of high-resolution three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of an unstable magnetised jet with an initially weak mean field, we demonstrate a self-sustained transition from laminar reconnection to fully developed turbulence in the absence of external forcing. We show that a three-dimensional current-sheet instability triggers stochastic reconnection, leading to persistent turbulent energy injection. Energy-budget analysis reveals that the coupling between the turbulent electromotive force and the magnetic mean shear dominates turbulent production, with magnetic fluctuations subsequently transferring energy to the kinetic field through a nonlinear cascade.",
