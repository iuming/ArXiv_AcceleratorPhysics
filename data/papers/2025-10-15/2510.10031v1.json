  "title": "Development of 3D Pixel Sensors via an 8-inch CMOS-Compatible Process",
  "abstract": "In the construction of High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) experiments, 3D pixel sensors have become indispensable components due to their superior radiation hardness, fast response, and low power consumption. However, there are still significant challenges in the process of 3D sensors manufacturing. In this work, single devices and arrays of 3D sensors based on 30 $\\mu$m epitaxial silicon wafer have been designed, simulated, fabricated, and tested. This process was developed on the 8-inch CMOS process platform of the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS). The key processes include Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) with the Bosch process, in-situ doping, and an innovative back-etching. After testing the 3D pixel sensors, we have summarized the leakage current and capacitance of devices with different sizes with respect to bias voltages. We also found that the fabricated devices were almost all successfully produced, which laid a strong foundation for subsequent large-scale mass production.",
