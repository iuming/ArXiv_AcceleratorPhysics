  "title": "Si3N4 membrane as entrance window for plasma-generated vacuum   ultraviolet (VUV) radiation",
  "abstract": "Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation produced by an atmospheric pressure plasma was successfully measured down to wavelengths of 58.4nm utilizing a 20nm thin Si3N4 membrane to transfer the VUV radiation into a vacuum monochromator. This method allows measurements without disturbing the plasma or the spectra. He2 absorption could be observed by filling the monochromator with He. Transmission of the Si3N4 membrane in the region of the He2 excimer continua (58nm to 100 nm) could indirectly be measured and confirms literature values.",
