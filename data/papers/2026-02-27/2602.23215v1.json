  "abstract": "This lecture starts with a brief historical introduction and an explanation how to get from Maxwell's Equations to a simple cavity. After simplifying and adapting the equations for their application to Radio Frequency problems, the most important formulae and characteristics for cavities and wave-guides are derived. The most common figures of merit are explained and some of the different cavity types are introduced. The alternative description of cavities as a lumped circuit model is then introduced, which is often used to characterise the cavity-coupler-generator interplay.",
