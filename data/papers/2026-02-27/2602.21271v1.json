  "title": "Kolmogorov Scaling for Total Energy and Cross Helicity in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence",
  "abstract": "The problem of scaling in isotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence has remained unresolved, with competing predictions of $k^{-5/3}$ (Kolmogorov) and $k^{-3/2}$ (Iroshnikov-Kraichnan) scalings. In this paper, we address this long-standing controversy using high-resolution numerical simulations on $8192^2$ and $1536^3$ grids. We show that the total energy and cross helicity spectra are closer to $k^{-5/3}$ than $k^{-3/2}$. The fluxes and structure functions of the total energy and cross helicity also demonstrate robust support for Kolmogorov scaling. The magnetic energy shows $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum, but the kinetic energy exhibits $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum; the latter spectrum is due to the energy transfers from the magnetic field to the velocity field.",
