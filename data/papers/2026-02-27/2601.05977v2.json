  "title": "Comment on Nuclear Fusion 66, 016012 (2026) and arXiv:2508.03561 by Richard Fitzpatrick, A Simple Model of Current Ramp-Up and Ramp-Down in Tokamaks",
  "abstract": "The article Nuclear Fusion \\textbf{66}, 016012 (2026) by Richard Fitzpatrick is based on fundamental errors in the physics of the poloidal magnetic flux in tokamaks. His paper was inspired by an article that I posted on arXiv in various versions, $\\big<$arxiv.org/abs/2507.05456$\\big>$. The September 9, 2025 version was submitted to the Physics of Plasmas, which flatly rejected the article. Before I can resubmit, the Physics of Plasmas stated that the issues with the Fitzpatrick article must be explained. Not only did Fitzpatrick make numerous fundamental errors in science, he totally misrepresented my views as clearly stated in my article and even more explicitly in email exchanges, called ``private communication\" in his paper.",
