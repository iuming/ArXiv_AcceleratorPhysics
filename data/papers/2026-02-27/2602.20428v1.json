  "title": "Conceptual Design of Highly-Constrained Splitters for the FFA@CEBAF Energy Upgrade Study",
  "abstract": "The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab is investigating a significant energy upgrade utilizing Fixed-Field Alternating-gradient (FFA) recirculating arcs. This upgrade requires the design of complex horizontal beam splitters to manage up to six concurrent beam passes. This paper presents the conceptual design of these splitters, which are subject to severe physical constraints imposed by the existing accelerator tunnel and multifaceted beam dynamics requirements for matching into the permanent-magnet FFA arcs. The design methodology, centered on multi-pass simulations in the Bmad toolkit, is detailed from the initial geometric layout through the advanced optics matching. Key results include a robust geometric arrangement that fits within the spatial boundaries and the development of multiple, flexible optics matching solutions. Furthermore, the design integrates a viable scheme for extracting high-energy beams for the experimental halls, a critical operational requirement. This work establishes a comprehensive and viable conceptual design, forming a baseline for future engineering and performance optimization studies.",
