  "title": "A note on thermal effects in non-linear models for plasma-based   acceleration",
  "abstract": "We investigate the impact of a non-negligible background temperature on relativistic plasma wakefields generated when a beam of charged particles passes through a neutral plasma at rest. Our analysis focuses on the blowout regime, where the plasma response is highly non-linear: plasma electrons are radially blown out and expelled away from the propagation axis of the beam particles, creating a region (bubble) of ions without electrons. Our study builds upon earlier investigations for non-linear models of plasma wakefields developed neglecting plasma temperature. In the presence of a non-zero background temperature, we characterize the bubble in terms of its transversal and longitudinal sizes as a function of the temperature. Model predictions and parametrizations are studied in combination with PIC simulations, and correctly reproduce the temperature induced contraction of both the longitudinal and transverse bubble sizes.",
