  "title": "Lead tungstate calorimeter of the Jefferson Lab Eta Factory experiment",
  "abstract": "A new electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) consisting of 1596 lead tungstate PbWO$_{\\rm 4}$ scintillating crystals has been fabricated and installed in the experimental Hall D at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The high-granularity, high-resolution calorimeter is required by the JLab Eta Factory experiment, whose main physics goal is to study rare decays of eta mesons. The ECAL replaced the inner part of the forward lead glass calorimeter of the GlueX detector. Signals from the detector will be digitized using twelve-bit flash analog-to-digital converters operated at a sampling rate of 250 MHz. The ECAL is integrated into the trigger system of the GlueX detector using electronics modules designed at JLab. The ECAL is currently at the commissioning stage and should be ready for the physics run in January 2025. We will give an overview of the JEF experiment, the design and construction of the ECAL, and the integration of the detector and its infrastructure into the Hall D experimental setup.",
