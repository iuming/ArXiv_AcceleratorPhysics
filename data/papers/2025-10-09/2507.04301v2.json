  "title": "Laser Amplification in $e^{-}$-$Î¼^{-}$-ion Plasmas",
  "abstract": "We investigate laser amplification in $e^{-}$-$\\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas, where negative muons partially replace electrons. Theoretical results reveal a hybrid plasma wave, called $\\mu$-wave that exhibits ion-acoustic behavior in long-wavelength regime and Langmuir-like behavior in short-wavelength regime. Besides, the Landau damping of $\\mu$-wave is smaller than that of Langmuir wave. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations confirm the theoretical results of instabilities in$e^{-}$-$\\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas. The $\\mu$-wave enables efficient laser amplification by suppressing pump-driven spontaneous instabilities through enhanced Landau damping of Langmuir waves. Compared to Raman amplification, $\\mu$-wave amplification can maintain the Gaussian waveform of the seed laser, avoiding pulse splitting. Compared to strongcoupling Brillouin amplification, $\\mu$-wave amplification exhibits weaker filamentation instability. Our theoretical model can be generalized to other plasma systems containing two species of negatively charged particles, such as two-temperature electron plasmas and negative-ion plasma. These findings establish $e^{-}$-$\\mu^{-}$-ion plasma as a promising medium for advanced laser amplification schemes.",
