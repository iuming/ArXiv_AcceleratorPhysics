  "title": "Short-Pulse High-Power THz Generation Using Optical Klystron FELs:   Simulation Results",
  "abstract": "We investigate the feasibility of extending the optical klystron (OK) concept into the terahertz (THz) regime, where strong radiation slippage and diffraction fundamentally challenge efficient free- electron laser (FEL) operation. Numerical simulations were carried out for resonant wavelengths of 10, 30, and 100 {\\mu}m using parameters relevant to the planned DALI facility. The results show that while long wavelengths exhibit rapid energy growth, they suffer from significant temporal broadening due to slippage, whereas shorter wavelengths require large dispersive strengths R56 to achieve sufficient bunching. Harmonic bunching is demonstrated as a viable alternative to reduce the required R56 at short wavelengths. Diffraction was analyzed and found not to limit the present design, as the radiation spot size remains well within the beamline aperture. To address the slippage challenge, we propose and numerically demonstrate a novel chicane-embedded optical delay scheme, which restores phase alignment between the radiation and microbunched electrons. Simulations confirm that careful tuning of the dispersive strengths allows staged amplification, preserving beam quality and reaching multi-megawatt output power. These results highlight the potential of THz- tailored optical klystrons to generate compact, short, and high-intensity THz pulses, and lay the groundwork for future experimental studies and facility implementation.",
