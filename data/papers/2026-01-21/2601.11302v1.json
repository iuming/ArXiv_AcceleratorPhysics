  "title": "Introduction to the Mechanical Design of Accelerators",
  "abstract": "Particle accelerators represent some of the most sophisticated engineering achievements of our time. Their construction requires a unique combination of physics insight and mechanical engineering expertise. The aim of this paper is to provide young mechanical engineers with an introduction to the principles, methods, and challenges associated with the mechanical design of accelerators. The lecture upon which this proceeding is based emphasized the translation of functional requirements into engineering specifications, the critical importance of robust and reliable design, and the need for precisely defined drawings supported by international standards such as ISO GPS and GD&T. Through illustrative examples and a practical case inspired by CERN's existing components, the paper underlines the necessity of anticipating lifecycle demands, ensuring manufacturability, and safeguarding operational reliability. Particular emphasis is placed on the contractual value of 2D drawings, the practical application of functional dimensioning, and tolerance chain analysis. By reviewing common pitfalls and exploring best practices, the paper seeks to orient engineers towards design choices that balance cost, reliability, and performance.",
