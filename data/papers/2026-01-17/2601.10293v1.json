  "title": "Updated electrical design of the Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injector in RFX-mod2",
  "abstract": "The Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injector of the RFX-mod2 experiment (Consorzio RFX, Padova) is expected to provide novel and significant information about the Reversed Field Pinch confinement of fusion plasmas. The injection of the hydrogen beam in the plasma will allow Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) and Motional Stark Effect diagnostics (MSE) to measure several quantities: ion speed, ion temperature, impurity content, intensity and pitch of the magnetic field. The DNBI is of particular importance for allowing the determination of these quantities at the core of the plasma. The present DNBI, built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, features an arc discharge H+ source, coupled to a 4-grid 50 keV acceleration system. The 50 ms, 5 A ion beam is neutralized by charge exchange by means of a gas target; residual ions are then deflected by a magnetic field before injection in the torus chamber. The beam can be modulated at maximum 250 Hz. The DNBI will undergo extraordinary maintenance and a structural upgrade to improve its reliability and safety. This contribution presents the latest upgrades of the electrical plants and of the control system of the DNBI.",
