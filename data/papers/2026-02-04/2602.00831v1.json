  "title": "Emerging Technologies and Methods in Wide-Area Search for Nuclear Materials",
  "abstract": "Canada, a Tier 1 nuclear nation involved in uranium mining and refining, operating nuclear power reactors, and with a Small Modular Reactor action plan, maintains a rigorous nuclear security infrastructure. The Nuclear Emergency Response team at Natural Resources Canada fulfills federal mandates in high-sensitivity air- and ground-based mobile survey for prevention, detection and response. A robust operational framework exists for deployment of traditional large-volume NaI(Tl)-based detection suites. At the same time, a research arm examines emerging non-nuclear technologies which can enhance the capabilities of the operational team. Herein, the potential for uncrewed mobile systems in nuclear security and emergency response operations is discussed. The impact of new technologies such as silicon photomultipliers, gamma imagers and self-shielding directional detectors is presented, and the use of high-performance computing in modelling of system response functions is discussed. Finally, a capability to extrapolate to the location of a source some distance away from a survey trajectory is shown. The extrapolation method includes propagation of the measurement error to the extrapolated region, essential information for nuclear response operators to know if a region is actually clear of radioactivity or not.",
