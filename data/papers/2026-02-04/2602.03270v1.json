  "title": "Computational Tools in EN-MME: Implicit and Explicit Finite-Element Simulations",
  "abstract": "This paper recalls the principles of the finite-element methods (FEM) theory and declines its application in the EN-MME group, for the numerical modelling and study of particle accelerator equipment. Implicit and explicit methods are compared, and practical examples of their use are given.",
