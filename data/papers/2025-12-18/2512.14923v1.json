  "title": "3D Printing as a Rapid Prototyping Approach for Novel RF Cavity Designs",
  "abstract": "3D-printing of radiofrequency (RF) cavity resonators could provide a cost-effective solution that enables rapid prototyping and design flexibility compared to traditional fabrication of full-metal cavities. In this work, the feasibility of fabrication of a useful multi-mode GHz cavity is explored. Two kinds of plastics, two slicing approaches and two metal coating techniques were used to build a series of clamped cavities with thin inner copper surface on otherwise 3D printed plastic surface. The cavities were then bench-tested to identify spatial field distributions, operating frequencies and quality factors (Q-factor). Pros and cons of the used fabrication approaches were identified and understood, and the performance of longitudinally sliced painted cavity design demonstrated considerable practicality of 3D-printing approach in designing rf systems.",
