  "title": "Generalized relativistic second order magnetohydrodynamics: A correlation function approach using Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator",
  "abstract": "We use total energy-momentum conservation and the Bianchi identity (magnetic-flux conservation) to construct second-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in a Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator (NESO) framework. We obtain all dissipative tensors in the medium by focusing on a relativistic magnetized plasma that preserves parity and is symmetric to charge-conjugation. We also provide Kubo formulas for all transport coefficients that arise at second order. Moreover, we extend the NESO formalism to systematically take into account for nonlocal contributions.",
