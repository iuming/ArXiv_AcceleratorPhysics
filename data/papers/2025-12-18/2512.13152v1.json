  "title": "Performance of USTC first batch resistive AC-LGAD sensor",
  "abstract": "In this paper, the design and characterization of AC-LGAD sensors at the University of Science and Technology of China is introduced. The sensors are characterized with an infrared laser Transient Current Technique (TCT) system for evaluating signal response characteristics and spatial resolution. The temporal resolution was quantified with electrons emitted by a Sr-90 radioactive source. The spatial resolution can reach 4 μm and a temporal resolution of 48 ps is achieved",
