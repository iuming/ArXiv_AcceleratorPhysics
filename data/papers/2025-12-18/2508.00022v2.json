  "title": "A pair polarimeter for multi-GeV $γ$-rays",
  "abstract": "Accessing the polarization of photon allows to understand the mechanisms behind its emission or scattering, revealing much about a peculiar environment or a probed object. For energy above $\\sim$10~MeV, the pair production dominates the photon-matter interaction and the photon polarization is accessible via the azimuthal angle of the conversion. Unfortunately pair polarimeters have a low figure-of-merit for multi-GeV photons and are mostly used for beam characterization. In this paper, we report a new concept of a compact pair polarimeter associating monolithic active pixel sensors to low-density extended solid converters to reach simultaneously a high efficiency of $\\sim$7\\% and intrinsic analyzing power ranging from 0.2 to 0.5. This new concept will add a new obersvable to the multi-messenger physics, isolate the intrinsic strong force in nucleons and possibly reveal violations of Lorentz invariance.",
