  "title": "Channel-Level Calibration Methods of Silicon Photomultiplier for JUNO-TAO Central Detector",
  "abstract": "The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO or JUNO-TAO) is a satellite observatory for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), located 44 meters away from the No.1 reactor of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. TAO can measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with excellent energy resolution (better than 2\\% at 1 MeV) using state-of-the-art Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) operated at low temperature. To achieve this goal, the SiPMs (together with their readout electronics) must be well calibrated. This paper presents the channel-level calibration methods for the dark count rate (DCR), relative photon detection efficiency (PDE), time offset, gain, and internal optical crosstalk (IOCT) of the SiPMs based on charge and time information of the collected events. For the calibration of the external optical crosstalk (EOCT), in terms of its rate and emission angle distribution, a novel method is proposed by switching on and off different groups of SiPMs with an LED placed in the detector. Using one million simulated events, the expected calibration biases are evaluated for all the aforementioned parameters: relative PDE (2.1\\%), IOCT (1.4\\%), DCR (0.4\\%), EOCT Rate ($<0.1\\%$), gain ($<0.1\\%$), time offset (0.027 ns). The emission angle distribution of the EOCT photons could be measured with a bias of less than 4\\% in main angular range.",
