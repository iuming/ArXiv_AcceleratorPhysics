  "title": "Performance Reconstruction of Eco-Friendly Gas Mixtures for Improved Resistive Plate Chambers at GIF++ Using Geant4",
  "abstract": "A macroscopic reconstruction is developed to infer iRPC performance using Geant4 observables and one experimental anchor. The Geant4 energy deposition is used to estimate the primary ionization yield, while the efficiency turn-on is modeled through an induced-charge description encoded in an effective gain G(E). The absolute scale is fixed by calibrating the standard CMS mixture to its GIF++ efficiency curve and extracting macroscopic Townsend parameters (A,B). The same procedure is propagated to four alternative mixtures, including two HFO and CO2 eco-friendly blends, to reconstruct efficiency curves and working points, enabling detector mixture screening without microscopic transport inputs.",
