  "title": "Charged particle energization by low-amplitude electrostatic waves at cyclotron harmonics",
  "abstract": "The system made by a charged particle interacting with a single electrostatic wave which propagates perpendicularly to the magnetic field, at a frequency larger than the cyclotron one, has been extensively studied in literature due to its implications with ion heating in magnetized plasmas. It is known that a threshold in the electrostatic potential must be exceeded in order for stochastic particle motion and heating to occur. Regardless its amplitude, however, the electrostatic wave induces a periodic oscillation in the particle motion. We show, by analytical and numerical arguments, that this dynamics is non-adiabatic, meaning that the particle does not land back to its initial state when the wave is slowly turned off. This way, particle energization (although, not rigorously heating) occurs even under sub-threshold conditions.",
