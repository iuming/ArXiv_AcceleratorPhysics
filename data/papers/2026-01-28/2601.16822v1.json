  "title": "Design and characterization of the POKERINO prototype for the POKER/NA64 experiment at CERN",
  "abstract": "The NA64 experiment at CERN H4 beamline recently started a high-energy positron-beam program to search for light dark matter particles through a thick-target, missing-energy measurement. To fulfil the energy resolution requirement of the physics measurement $σ_E/E\\simeq2.5\\%/\\sqrt{E\\mathrm{[GeV}]} \\oplus 0.5\\%$ and cope with the constraints and performance requests of the NA64 setup, a new high-resolution homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter PKR-CAL has been designed. The detector is based on PbWO$_4$ crystals, each read by multiple SiPM sensors to maximize the light collection. The PKR-CAL design has been optimized to mitigate and control unavoidable SiPM saturation effects at high light levels, as well as to minimize the gain fluctuations induced by instantaneous variations of the H4 beam intensity. The $R\\&D$ program culminated in the construction of a small-scale prototype, POKERINO. In this work, we present the results from the experimental characterization campaign of the POKERINO aiming at demonstrating that the obtained performances are compatible with the application requirements.",
