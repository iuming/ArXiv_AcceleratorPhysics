  "title": "In-Situ Performance of FBK VUV-HD3 and HPK VUV4 SiPMs in the LoLX Liquid Xenon Detector",
  "abstract": "Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are a critical technology for the next generation of rare-event search experiments using liquid xenon (LXe). While two VUV-sensitive SiPMs are available, comprehensive in-situ studies are needed to inform detector design and compare device response. This work presents a direct comparison of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) VUV-HD3 and Hamamatsu (HPK) VUV4 SiPMs operated simultaneously within the Light-only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) detector. Using data collected with gamma sources placed outside the detector, we characterized the relative performance of these photosensors. Our analysis reveals that under these operating conditions, the HPK SiPMs are 33-38% less efficient than the FBK devices, a larger difference than predicted by standard PDE models in vacuum measurement. We show that this discrepancy is resolved by our angular and wavelength dependent PDE model incorporating surface shadowing effects into our optical simulation, which then accurately reproduces the experimental data. This finding has significant implications for the selection and implementation of photosensors in future large-scale LXe detectors.",
