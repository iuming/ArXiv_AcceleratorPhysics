  "title": "Space-Charge Effects During Half-Integer Resonance Crossing in the CERN PSB",
  "abstract": "The survival of charged particles in synchrotrons requires avoiding setting the beam on machine resonances, the most dangerous of which are the integer and half-integer. Nevertheless, operationally, the transverse tunes may change dynamically, crossing these resonances, and resulting in unwanted beam quality degradation and beam loss. For high intensity beams the process of resonance crossing is even more critical as space charge, in addition to the incoherent effects, may generate also coherent effects on the beam envelope dynamics. The interplay of the speed of resonance crossing, the space charge incoherent tune spread, and half-integer resonance width are fundamental for the beam behavior. In this paper we study the crossing of the half-integer resonance $2Q_y=9$ in the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster~(PSB) for a range of parameters using a coasting beam. We take advantage of the newly commissioned PSB to investigate the beam response experimentally. The experimental findings are also discussed with the support of simulations.",
