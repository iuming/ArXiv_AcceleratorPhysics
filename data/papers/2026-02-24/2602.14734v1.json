  "title": "An x-ray regenerative amplifier free-electron laser with a step-tapered-undulator",
  "abstract": "Regenerative amplifier x-ray free-electron lasers constitute alternative configurations for fourth generation light sources which are typically operated in self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) mode. However, SASE exhibits relatively large fluctuations in the power and spectral properties from shot to shot, whereas XRAFELs provide a much more stable source of hard x-ray photons. Here, we study the performance of an x-ray cavity under consideration at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Facility using both uniform and step-tapered undulators with either transmissive or hole out-coupling.",
