  "title": "A Kinetic Route to Helicity-Constrained Decay",
  "abstract": "Through 2D3V PIC simulations of freely decaying sub-ion turbulence, intermittent localized regions with $\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\neq 0$ are found to be statistically associated with reductions in the magnitude of magnetic helicity while evolving in the early electron-scale interaction phase. Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \\sim \\text{const}$. For initially net-helical configurations, we observe rapid development of mixed-signed magnetic helicity patches and a decrease of the global fractional helicity, such that the decay over the kinetic interval is again most consistent with the cancellation-dominated scaling constraint.",
