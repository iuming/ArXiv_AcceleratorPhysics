  "title": "FLUKA-Based Optimization of Muon Production Target Design for a Muon Collider Demonstrator",
  "abstract": "This study investigates how target geometry and material influence pion and muon production from an 8 GeV proton beam, in support of target-system design for a muon collider demonstrator. A 2 m long, 0.7 m radius solenoid with a 5 T peak magnetic field is used to capture secondary particles, with the target positioned at its center. We examine how variations in target radius, length, and material affect secondary-beam yield and emittance at the solenoid exit. In parallel, we evaluate temperature rise within the target to assess material limitations and guide future work on thermal and structural survivability. The results provide initial intuition for optimizing both particle yield and target durability in muon collider front-end systems.",
