  "title": "Standards and Safety: an Overview",
  "abstract": "This note is intended to provide an overview of the implications of regulations and standards on the safety of mechanical equipment, with a focus on accelerator components. Each research facility has different internal rules and standards which are applicable to specific cases; however, the main reference legal frame in Europe is everywhere based on the applicable European Directives. After a brief introduction to the 'safety' for mechanical systems, the process of 'risk analysis' will be introduced. The majority of this note will then deal with regulations and standards for pressure and cryogenic equipment. The European Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) will be briefly described, together with the concept of 'harmonized standards' and their implications on the entire lifecycle of a pressure equipment, with some hints at the peculiarities of accelerator components. In the second part of this note, regulations and standards for machinery, load-lifting accessories and buildings will be briefly mentioned to complete the picture of the most common cases in an accelerator facility.",
