  "title": "Data-Driven Calibration of Large Liquid Detectors with Unsupervised Learning",
  "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a novel method to extract photomultiplier tube (PMT) calibration timing constants in large liquid scintillation detectors from physics data using the machinery of unsupervised deep learning. The approach uses a simplified physical model of optical photon transport in the loss function, with PMT calibration constants treated as free parameters, and the simple assumption that individual events represent point-like emission. The problem is, thus, effectively reduced to that of regression on a very large scale, made tractable by deep learning architectures and automatic differentiation frameworks. Using data from the 9,300 PMTs in the SNO+ detector, the method has been shown to reliably extract 3 calibration constants for each of the over 7,500 online PMTs using radioactive background events. We believe that this basic approach can be straightforwardly generalised for a wide range of applications.",
