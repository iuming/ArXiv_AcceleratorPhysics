  "title": "High-precision Beam Optics Calculation of the HIAF-BRing Using Measured Fields",
  "abstract": "The construction of the High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) has been completed, with current efforts focused on subsystem commissioning. Beam commissioning is scheduled for autumn 2025, marking a critical milestone in the HIAF project. This paper presents high-precision optics calculations for the Booster Ring (BRing) of HIAF, a key component for achieving stable heavy-ion beam acceleration. Leveraging high-precision magnetic field data, each magnet is divided into hundreds of slices, thus establishing a high-precision sliced optics model for BRing. Detailed calculations of BRing's optics are presented in this work. Critical parameters including tunes and betatron functions of the lattice based on the measured magnetic fields and those of the ideal lattice have been compared. The results highlight the impact of realistic magnetic field on beam dynamics and provide essential insights for accelerator tuning and optimization. These findings serve as a fundamental reference for beam commissioning and long-term operation, ensuring beam stability and performance reproducibility in HIAF.",
