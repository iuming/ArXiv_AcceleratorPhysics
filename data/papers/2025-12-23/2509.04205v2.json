  "title": "Toward precision physics tests with future COHERENT detectors",
  "abstract": "We present a comprehensive sensitivity study of future CE$ν$NS detectors, focusing on a cryogenic cesium iodide detector and a tonne-scale liquid argon one, currently being developed by the COHERENT Collaboration. These setups will enable precision measurements of the weak mixing angle at low energies and allow accurate extraction of the neutron nuclear distribution radius. We also demonstrate that next-generation detectors will place constraints on the neutrino charge radius comparable to or better than current global fits. In addition, we explore the sensitivity to non standard neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as magnetic moments and millicharges, as well as new mediators. These findings reinforce the role of CE$ν$NS experiments in the upcoming precision era, with future detectors playing a key role in advancing our understanding of neutrino interactions and electroweak physics at low energies.",
