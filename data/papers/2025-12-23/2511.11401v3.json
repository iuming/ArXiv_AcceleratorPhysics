  "title": "GRANITE: High-Resolution Imaging and Electrical Qualification of Large-Area TPC Electrodes",
  "abstract": "Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for comprehensive electrode quality assurance. The system is built around the GRANITE (Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes) facility: a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.   We developed a coaxial wire scanning head to measure and correlate localized high-voltage discharge currents in air with high-resolution surface images. We find that the identified discharge 'hotspots' are transient and show no significant correlation with static visual features. Next, we established a quantitative relationship between artificially induced abrasive surface damage on the wires and a reduction in the discharge inception voltage. This work provides a novel non-invasive tool for qualifying wires dedicated for use in electrodes for future low-background experiments.",
