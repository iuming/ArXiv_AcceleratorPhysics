  "title": "Asymptotic state of nonlinear Landau damping in one-dimensional plasma",
  "abstract": "In this work, the asymptotic state of nonlinear Landau damping in one-dimensional plasma has been examined using a quasi-linear model and a second-order symplectic integrator. The dispersion relation of the plateau distribution function for the steady-state solution of the quasi-linear mode is extended to the complex plane and compared with the nonlinear simulation. We determine that the asymptotic state of the collisionless plasma is a multi-wave BGK structure. This structure is characterized by multiple vortices in phase space, which correspond to distinct peaks in the frequency-wavenumber (ω, k) spectrum of the electric field",
