  "title": "Development and performance evaluation of a water-based liquid scintillator tracking detector with wavelength-shifting fiber readout",
  "abstract": "We have developed a novel tracking detector utilizing a water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) for the accurate characterization of neutrino interactions on a water target. In this detector, the WbLS is optically segmented into small cells by reflective separators, and the scintillation light is read out in three directions using wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon photomultipliers. We developed and optimized WbLS samples for this application and measured their light yield using cosmic-ray muons. Subsequently, we constructed a prototype of the WbLS tracking detector and evaluated its performance with a positron beam. The beam test demonstrated good tracking performance, although the light yield was lower than required. The result prompted a review of the surfactant used in the WbLS and the material of the optical separators, leading to a significant improvement in light yield. In this paper, we report on a design of the WbLS tracking detector, the development of the WbLS, the results of the beam test, and subsequent improvements to the WbLS and optical separators.",
