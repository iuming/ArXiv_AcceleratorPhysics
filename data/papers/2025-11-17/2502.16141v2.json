  "title": "A Hybrid Neural Architecture: Online Attosecond X-ray Characterization",
  "abstract": "The emergence of high-repetition-rate x-ray free-electron lasers, such as SLAC's LCLS-II, serve as our canonical example for autonomous controls that necessitate high-throughput diagnostics paired with streaming computational pipelines capable of single-shot analysis with extremely low latency. We present the Deterministic Characterization with an Integrated Parallelizable Hybrid Resolver architecture, a hybrid machine learning framework designed for fast, accurate analysis of XFEL diagnostics using angular streaking-based sinogram images. This architecture integrates convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory models to denoise input, identify x-ray sub-spike features, and extract sub-spike relative delays with sub-30 attosecond temporal resolution. Deployed on low-latency hardware, it achieves over 10~kHz throughput with \\SI{168.3}{\\micro\\second} inference latency, indicating scalability to 14~kHz with FPGA integration. By transforming regression tasks into classification problems and leveraging optimized error encoding, we achieve high precision with low-latency performance that is critical for real-time streaming event selection and experimental control feedback signals. This represents a key development in real-time control pipelines for next-generation autonomous science, generally, and high repetition-rate x-ray experiments in particular.",
