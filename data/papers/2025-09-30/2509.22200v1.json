  "title": "A minimalist self-differencing gating scheme for dead-time-free   single-photon avalanche diodes at high repetition rate",
  "abstract": "Gated quenched SPAD detectors are widely used in quantum communication and quantum computing setups employing high-repetition-rate lasers. Here, we present a novel scheme for high-repetition-rate (100 MHz) sine-wave gated SPADs, based on the self-differencing technique, which significantly simplifies previous designs while offering additional advantages. These include straightforward implementation, more precise control of the SPAD biasing, and an improved SNR. We implemented this approach using an InGaAs photodiode and characterized it experimentally with 100 MHz attenuated laser pulses, measuring quantum efficiency, dark count rate, and afterpulsing behavior. Importantly, we demonstrate that the detector recovers full quantum efficiency in less than one pulse-repetition period after a detection event, enabling continuous operation at 100 MHz, which, in principle, could reach the GHz regime.",
