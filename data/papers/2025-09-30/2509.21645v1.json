  "title": "Generation of directed electron beams by tight focusing of an ultrashort   IR laser in a near-critical plasma",
  "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of accelerating electrons to MeV energies in ambient air using tightly focused laser configurations. In this article, we explore possible strategies to control and optimize the resulting electron beams using laser and gas parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that in near-critical plasmas, linearly and circularly polarized pulses are more efficient than radially polarized pulses for electron acceleration. In addition, electron beams obtained from linearly polarized pulses have lower divergence angles. By studying the efficiency of the acceleration process - characterized by the maximum kinetic energy of electrons and their total number - we identify optimal conditions in ambient air at wavelength lambda_0 approximately 1.5 micrometers and a_0 >= 15. We also scale our results to lower-density air and demonstrate that some noble gases (Ne, Ar) are suitable media for accelerating electrons. Our investigations show that this acceleration scheme enables multi-MeV electrons with low divergence using millijoule-class high-repetition rate lasers, making it a promising candidate for applications in medical sciences and ultrafast imaging.",
