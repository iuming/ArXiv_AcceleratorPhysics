  "title": "Saturation of the kinetic ballooning instability due to the electron   parallel nonlinearity",
  "abstract": "The electron parallel nonlinearity (EPN) is implemented in the gyrokinetic Particle-in-Cell turbulence code GEM [Y. Chen and S. E. Parker, J. Comp. Phys. 220, 839 (2007)]. Application to the Cyclone Base Case reveals a strong effect of EPN on the saturated heat transport above the kinetic ballooning mode threshold. Evidence is provided to show that the strong effect is associated with the electron radial motion due to magnetic fluttering, which turns fine structures of the KBM eigenmode in radius into fine structures in velocity and increases the magnitude of the EPN term in the kinetic equation.",
