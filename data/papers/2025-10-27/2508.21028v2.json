  "title": "Response of AC-coupled Low Gain Avalanche Detectors to Ionizing and   Non-ionizing Radiation Damage",
  "abstract": "Low gain avalanche diodes with DC- and AC-coupled readout were exposed to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation at levels relevant to future experiments in particle, nuclear, and medical physics and to astrophysics. Damage-related change in their acceptor removal constants and in the resistivity of the region between the guard ring and the active area are reported, as is change in the leakage current and depletion voltages of the active volumes.",
