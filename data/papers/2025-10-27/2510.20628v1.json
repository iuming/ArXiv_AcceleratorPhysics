  "title": "Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by   Magnetically Dominated Turbulence",
  "abstract": "We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\\kappa$ tails for $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\\bf v}_E \\cdot {\\bf \\kappa}$, with ${\\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\\bf\\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.",
