    "title": "Performance and long-term aging studies on Eco-Friendly Resistive Plate   Chamber detectors",
    "abstract": "Resistive Plate Chambers detectors are extensively used in several domains of Physics. In High Energy Physics, they are typically operated in avalanche mode with a high-performance gas mixture based on Tetrafluoroethane (C2H2F4), a fluorinated high Global Warming Potential greenhouse gas. The RPC EcoGas@GIF++ Collaboration has pursued an intensive R\\&D activity to search for new gas mixtures with low environmental impact, fulfilling the performance expected for the LHC operations as well as for future and different applications. Here, results obtained with new eco-friendly gas mixtures based on Tetrafluoropropene and carbon dioxide, even under high-irradiation conditions, will be presented. Long-term aging tests carried out at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility will be discussed along with their possible limits and future perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Following Lortz, we construct a family of smooth steady states of the ideal, incompressible Euler equation in three dimensions that possess no continuous Euclidean symmetry. As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.",

    "title": "Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory   Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties",
    "abstract": "X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.",

    "title": "Electrospray Thruster Plume Impingement on CubeSat Solar Arrays: A   Particle-Tracking Study",
    "abstract": "Electrospray thrusters are emerging as a leading propulsion technology for CubeSats, offering high specific impulse ($I_{sp} > 1000$ s) and low power requirements. However, the divergent ion plumes can impinge on spacecraft surfaces, particularly body-mounted solar arrays, causing contamination and thrust efficiency losses. This study presents a validated particle-tracking simulation to quantify the effects of thruster placement on thrust efficiency and surface contamination for 1U, 3U, and 6U CubeSats. The plume model employs a cosine power distribution ($k=1.8$) with half-angle $46^\\circ$, validated against experimental data with errors below 7%. Results show that thrust efficiency ranges from 53.6% for rear-mounted thrusters on 3U body-mounted configurations to 100% for side-mounted configurations with deployable arrays. CubeSat size significantly affects impingement: 3U platforms experience 46.4% contamination with rear-mounted thrusters compared to 16.6% for 1U. Deployable solar arrays reduce contamination by 77% compared to body-mounted arrays, while side-mounted thrusters eliminate impingement entirely at the cost of only 1.6% efficiency loss. Corner-mounted configurations at $30^\\circ$ cant provide intermediate performance with 88.9% efficiency and 11.1% contamination. These quantitative design guidelines enable mission planners to optimize thruster integration based on power budget and propellant mass constraints, with statistical uncertainty below 0.15% across all configurations.",

    "abstract": "In this work, an innovative scheme is proposed that exploits the response of magnetized plasmas to realize a refractive index exceeding unity for right circularly polarized (RCP) waves. Using two- and three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the OSIRIS 4.0 framework, it is shown that a shaped magnetized plasma lens (MPL) can act as a glass/solid-state-based convex lens, amplifying laser intensity via transverse focusing. Moreover, by integrating three key ingredients, a tailored plasma lens geometry, a spatially structured strong magnetic field, and a suitably chirped laser pulse, simultaneous focusing and compression of the pulse has been achieved. The simulations reveal up to a 100-fold increase in laser intensity, enabled by the combined action of the MPL and the chirped pulse profile. With recent advances in high-field magnet technology, shaped plasma targets, and controlled chirped laser systems, this approach offers a promising pathway toward experimentally reaching extreme intensities.",

Several such structures were produced and compared to the standard 1 mm-thick two-electrode ThGEM.

    "abstract": "We investigate laser amplification in $e^{-}$-$\\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas, where negative muons partially replace electrons. Theoretical results reveal a hybrid plasma wave, called $\\mu$-wave that exhibits ion-acoustic behavior in long-wavelength regime and Langmuir-like behavior in short-wavelength regime. Besides, the Landau damping of $\\mu$-wave is smaller than that of Langmuir wave. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations confirm the theoretical results of instabilities in$e^{-}$-$\\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas. The $\\mu$-wave enables efficient laser amplification by suppressing pump-driven spontaneous instabilities through enhanced Landau damping of Langmuir waves. Compared to Raman amplification, $\\mu$-wave amplification can maintain the Gaussian waveform of the seed laser, avoiding pulse splitting. Compared to strongcoupling Brillouin amplification, $\\mu$-wave amplification exhibits weaker filamentation instability. Our theoretical model can be generalized to other plasma systems containing two species of negatively charged particles, such as two-temperature electron plasmas and negative-ion plasma. These findings establish $e^{-}$-$\\mu^{-}$-ion plasma as a promising medium for advanced laser amplification schemes.",

In an improved BIPM-type magnet design by Tsinghua University, an open/close surface was incorporated, facilitating operation. However, an unavoidable mechanical air gap at the splitting plane introduces asymmetry in the magnetic flux density profile, degrading field uniformity. This study proposes a two-step yoke compensation method to restore symmetry by adjusting the upper outer yoke's inner radius and the splitting gap height. Finite element simulations show linear relationships between asymmetry and these parameters, enabling predictive compensation. Experimental results confirm that sequential tuning successfully eliminates asymmetry and recovers the designed uniform field range. The method provides an effective solution for enhancing magnetic field quality in openable Kibble balance magnets.",

    "title": "Modeling frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments",
    "abstract": "Modern resonant sensing tools can achieve increasingly high quality factors, which correspond to extremely narrow linewidths. In such systems, time-variation of the resonator's natural frequency can potentially impact its ability to accumulate power and its resulting sensitivity. One such example is the Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with quality factors of $Q\\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of the cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with amplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a large suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the effects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing the Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of jittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely, when the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates power as if there were no jittering at all. This implies that the sensitivity of a jittering resonator is comparable to that of a stable resonator. In the case of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\\sim 10\\%$ loss in power. Our results allow the dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run to be refined, leading to a constraint that is an order of magnitude stronger than previously reported (corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio which is four orders of magnitude larger). This result represents the world-leading constraint on dark photons over a wide range of masses below $6\\,\\rm \\mu eV$ and translates to the best laboratory-based limits on the photon mass $m_\\gamma<2.9\\times 10^{-48}\\,\\rm g$.",

The energy spectra of our forced MHD simulations on $8192^2$, $4096^2$, $1024^3$, and $512^3$ support Kolmogorov's k^{-5/3} spectrum over Iroshnikov-Kraichnan's k^{-3/2} spectrum, but the difference in the spectral exponents is small. However, the numerically computed third-order structure functions and intermittency exponents support Kolmogorov scaling in both two and three dimensions. Also, the energy fluxes of the imbalance MHD follow the predictions of Kolmogorov scaling. These results would help in better modelling of solar wind, solar corona, and dynamos.",

    "title": "Radiopurity screening of materials for rare event searches by neutron   activation at the TRIGA reactor of Pavia",
    "abstract": "In the framework of physics experiments searching for rare events, the selection of extremely radiopure materials is a challenging task, as the signal of interest is often hidden by instrumental background. Neutron activation is a powerful technique to measure trace contaminants with high sensitivity but, to be properly applied, it requires a good characterization of neutron irradiation and $\\gamma$-spectroscopy facilities. This paper presents the state-of-the-art workflow adopted by the Radioactivity Laboratory of the University of Milano-Bicocca for radiopurity screening of materials by neutron activation performed at the TRIGA reactor in Pavia. The ultimate sensitivity of the described workflow, in the absence of interfering activation products and without the application of radiochemical and/or active background rejection techniques, is $<10^{-14}$ g/g for $^{40}$K, $<10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{238}$U and of the order of $10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{232}$Th contaminations. Further details are here provided to address systematic uncertainties related to neutron irradiation that may bias results. To this aim, a dedicated neutron activation campaign was performed and the data were analyzed exploiting a Monte Carlo simulation model of the reactor and applying an unfolding technique to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the neutron flux in typical irradiation configurations. The results of this work provide a valuable benchmark for the application of neutron activation in future radiopurity screening campaigns.",

    "abstract": "In recent electron-positron colliders designed and operated with very low emittance and high current, the energy density of the beam has increased significantly compared to earlier designs. Under these conditions, interactions between the beam and residual materials within the beam pipe exert considerable mutual influence. The residual materials are heated by the beam, leading to evaporation, charging, and possible fission, eventually resulting in a plasma state. Conversely, the beam undergoes emittance growth due to electromagnetic interactions with the resulting plasma. We investigate the effects of such dust-induced plasma on the beam through numerical simulations of these processes.",

    "abstract": "We present a structure-preserving discretization of the hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-driftkinetic system for simulations of low-frequency wave-particle interactions. The model equations are derived from a variational principle, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and driftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a finite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a particle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme is the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in the Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The resulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into skew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the non-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based on discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python package \\texttt{STRUPHY}. Numerical experiments confirm the energy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to simulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\\'en eigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This capability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for high-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems.",

    "abstract": "Accurately incorporating non-local transport into radiation-hydrodynamics codes, and indeed any fluid system, has long been elusive. To date, a simplified and accurate theory that can be easily integrated has not been available. This limitation affects modeling in inertial confinement fusion and magnetic confinement fusion systems, among others, where non-local transport is well-known to be present. Here, we present a coupling methodology between a full Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) electron kinetic code and radiation-hydrodynamics (rad-hydro) codes. The VFP code is used to adjust native electron transport in the rad-hydro code, thus enabling improved transport without the need to integrate a full electron VFP solver into the rad-hydro code. This approach necessitates only occasional invocation of the VFP code, reducing computational intensity compared to following the dynamic evolution entirely with the VFP code on fluid time scales. We illustrate that the methodology is more accurate than other simplified methods in thermal decay systems relevant to inertial confinement fusion and can replicate standard theoretical results with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), Thomson scattering (TS) is a widely used diagnostic technique for probing plasma conditions. We present a first-principles numerical approach to obtaining scattered light signals of ion acoustic features with high resolution in angle and frequency space using particle-in-cell simulations under typical ICF conditions. Our method demonstrates good agreement with existing theories for thermal collective TS. In the super-thermal collective regime, the results align with theory when the driven plasma modes are well-matched in wave vectors to the probe and collecting beams. Moreover, we also find that TS signals can remain significant even under imperfect wave-vector matching-a result that contradicts the conventional expectation that the TS spectrum strictly follows the plasma density spectrum. We attribute this discrepancy to a beating wave mechanism arising from the interaction between the probe beam and driven plasma density modulations. Our work thus provides a practical framework for interpreting TS signals from driven ion modes, a common yet complex feature in ICF plasmas.",

Simulations indicate that reconstruction combining hit positions and energy deposits achieves a zenith resolution of 1.5--4.0$^\\circ$ across most of the zenith range.

    "abstract": "Rasnik is a three-point optical displacement sensor originally developed for particle detector alignment in high-energy physics experiments, including the muon chambers of L3 at LEP and ATLAS at the LHC. The system has evolved from four-quadrant photodiodes to CMOS pixel sensors with custom ChessField coded masks, enabling absolute position measurement with no cumulative drift due to absolute value coded. Key advantages include electromagnetic immunity through purely optical measurement principles, working distances from 50 mm to 15 m, and multi-degree-of-freedom sensitivity perpendicular to the optical axis. RasCal, a comprehensive control and analysis software, is presented in this paper and its real-time image processing shows 5 pm/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ spatial resolution. With GPU acceleration, 274.5 Hz is achieved during live camera acquisition and 109 Hz on CPU. In maximum-throughput configurations, the processing rates exceed 300 Hz on simple consumer hardware. System performance is demonstrated across diverse applications: 5 pm/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ displacement sensitivity is achieved in the VATIGrav setup, dynamic behavior is characterized with a Watt's linkage. In addition, the lack of cumulative drift due to absolute coding with minimal thermal sensitivity under controlled conditions is used for vibration and thermal characterization of photodiode mounts for the LISA space mission. Millisecond-level command latency and thread-safe multi-camera support are provided by the RasCal software, establishing it as a robust and cost-effective precision measurement solution for demanding alignment applications in gravitational-wave detectors and space instrumentation.",

    "title": "Scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes for   ultrafast timing over keV-GeV energy scales",
    "abstract": "Precise measurement of radiation has long played a vital role in a wide range of research and industrial fields, from fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model to medical imaging such as time-of-flight positron emission tomography. Developing radiation detectors that achieve high timing precision-on the order of a few tens of picoseconds-and energy measurement capabilities remains indispensable yet challenging. In this study, we developed two types of scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (SCI-IMPs), one incorporating barium fluoride, and the other bismuth germanate, to enable simultaneous high-precision timing and energy measurements. To evaluate their performance over a wide energy range from keV- to GeV-scale, electron-positron annihilation gamma rays and cosmic ray muons were used. For energy measurements, both detectors achieved an energy resolution of approximately 35% at 511 keV. For timing measurements using 511 keV, coincidence time resolutions (CTRs) of approximately 50 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) were obtained for both detectors. In contrast, for cosmic ray muon experiments where cosmic ray muon energy is typically on the order of GeV, CTRs were measured to be 25.1 and 16.8 ps FWHM for barium fluoride- and bismuth germanate-based detectors, respectively. The versatile scintillator-integration technique established in this study can broaden the applicability of the newly developed SCI-IMPs. In particular, these results demonstrate that the developed detectors push the boundaries of timing performance while retaining energy measurement and hold promise for future applications in fundamental physics experiments and medical imaging.",

    "title": "AI-Assisted Object Condensation Clustering for Calorimeter Shower   Reconstruction at CLAS12",
    "abstract": "Several nuclear physics studies using the CLAS12 detector rely on the accurate reconstruction of neutrons and photons from its forward angle calorimeter system. These studies often place restrictive cuts when measuring neutral particles due to an overabundance of false clusters created by the existing calorimeter reconstruction software. In this work, we present a new AI approach to clustering CLAS12 calorimeter hits based on the object condensation framework. The model learns a latent representation of the full detector topology using GravNet layers, serving as the positional encoding for an event's calorimeter hits which are processed by a Transformer encoder. This unique structure allows the model to contextualize local and long range information, improving its performance. Evaluated on one million simulated $e+p$ collision events, our method significantly improves cluster trustworthiness: the fraction of reliable neutron clusters, increasing from 8.88\\% to 30.73\\%, and photon clusters, increasing from 51.07\\% to 64.73\\%. Our study also marks the first application of AI clustering techniques for hodoscopic detectors, showing potential for usage in many other experiments.",

    "title": "Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current   sheets in 2D MHD simulations?",
    "abstract": "We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers $10^3 \\le S \\le 2 \\times 10^5$. Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo \\& Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \\sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.",

    "title": "Spectroscopic measurements of graphite electrode erosion on the ZaP-HD   sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch device",
    "abstract": "The ionizations per photon, or S/XB, method uses spectroscopic measurements of radiating impurity ions to determine the influx from a solid surface. It is highly useful as a non-perturbing, in-situ measure of the gross erosion flux of plasma-facing components (PFCs). In sheared-flow-stabilized (SFS) Z-pinch devices, the electrode supplies the plasma current and directly contacts the core Z-pinch plasma. Electrode erosion due to the large particle and heat fluxes affects electrode durability, which is an important factor in existing and future devices. An improved understanding of these plasma-electrode interactions is required, in particular as energy density increases. Experiments on the ZaP-HD device investigate erosion of the graphite electrode by applying the S/XB method for C-III emission at 229.7 nm. The S/XB coefficients are determined from electron density and temperature profiles obtained from Digital Holographic Interferometry (DHI) measurements. An approach for expanding these profiles to represent plasma contacting the electrode is described. In both cases, the measured erosion fluxes are on the order of 10$^{30}$-10$^{31}$ atoms m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. These values are significantly larger than the expected erosion flux due to physical sputtering of H$^+$ ions on carbon, but are comparable to theoretical sublimation fluxes. This suggests that the source of carbon erosion flux is primarily from sublimation as opposed to sputtering. The dominance of sublimation over sputtering processes implies a difference in energy of the eroded neutrals which may provide insight on redeposition and net erosion behavior.",

    "title": "Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I. Langmuir   waves",
    "abstract": "Plasmas in various astrophysical systems are in non-equilibrium states as evidenced by direct in-situ measurements in the solar wind, solar corona and planetary environments as well as by indirect observations of various sources of waves and emissions in astrophysical systems. Specific are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, for whose description the most-used are the Kappa (power-law) distributions. With this paper we introduce a modeling alternative for linear waves in plasmas described by another non-equilibrium model, namely the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution. This can reproduce not only high-energy tails, but also low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons associated with the Earth's bow shock and interplanetary shocks or of electrons in the solar transition region. We derive the corresponding dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in terms of the newly introduced Druyvsteyn dispersion function, numerically compute, for the isotropic case, the dispersion curves as well as damping rates, and provide analytical approximation in the limit of weak damping. Thereby, we provide a new modeling tool that facilitates the quantitative treatment of a variety of non-Maxwellian plasmas.",

    "abstract": "In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that fluctuations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfv\\'enic, suggesting that shear-driven turbulence is possible even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.",

This is common in detectors like plastic scintillators. Current methods for calibrating these detectors often require manual adjustments. To address this, we propose a new method called the convolution model. This model accurately calibrates the energy-channel relationship of the Compton edge in various detectors. We tested it with plastic scintillator BC408, NaI crystal, and LaBr$_3$ crystal. Using ${}^{137}$Cs radioactive sources, we calibrated NaI and LaBr$_3$ detectors using full-energy peaks, then applied the convolution model to fit the Compton edge. Our results show errors within 1\\% when compared to full-energy peak calibration.",

    "title": "Measurements of the Birks' coefficient of GAGG:Ce using hard X-rays",
    "abstract": "Inorganic scintillators continue to be widely used within astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. This is in part thanks to the development of new scintillators, such as GAGG:Ce, as well as the availability of new scintillator readout sensors such as Silicon Photomultipliers and Silicon Drift Detectors. In order to use such scintillator materials for spectrometry or polarimetry, a detailed understanding of their response is important. One parameter that can affect the scintillator performance, particularly at lower photon energies, is their Birks' coefficienct, which correlates the relative light yield to the ionization energy. While for many high-Z inorganic scintillators this effect can be ignored, for GAGG:Ce this appears to not be the case. Here we provide a measurement of the Birks' coefficient for GAGG:Ce using data from two different detectors irradiated in the 20-80 keV energy range at the LARIX-A X-ray beam in Ferrara, Italy. While the effects due to Birks' law are visible below 30 keV, they also significantly influence the performance of GAGG:Ce performance near one of the K-edges, affecting both the measured gain and the energy resolution. Here, we use beam test data to derive the Birks' coefficient from GAGG:Ce. The results indicate that for usage in hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray missions, this coefficient has a significant effect on the measurements.",

Experimentally measured fields are among the highest to date for any Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, reaching a peak surface magnetic field of 105 mT. We also present a practical solution to the problem of cavity frequency tuning. Tuning by mechanical deformation has been a challenge with Nb3Sn due to its brittle nature, however, using a set of techniques tailored to the properties of thin-film Nb$_3$Sn on Nb, we can repeatably tune the cavity to the ATLAS master clock frequency after it is cooled, while maintaining the excellent performance characteristics.

    "title": "Calibration of Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors for Rare Event   Searches",
    "abstract": "The calibration of the CR39 and Makrofol Nuclear Track Detectors of the MoEDAL experiment at the CERN-LHC was performed by exposing stacks of detector foils to heavy ion beams with energies ranging from 340 MeV/nucleon to 150 GeV/nucleon. After chemical etching, the base areas and lengths of etch-pit cones were measured using automatic and manual optical microscopes. The response of the detectors, as measured by the ratio of the track-etching rate over the bulk-etching rate, was determined over a range extending from their threshold at Z/$\\beta\\sim7$ and $\\sim50$ for CR39 and Makrofol, respectively, up to Z/$\\beta\\sim92$",

    "title": "High-accuracy low-noise electrical measurements in a closed-cycle   pulse-tube cryostat",
    "abstract": "A shift of paradigm to obtain (sub-)Kelvin environment is currently on-going with the democratization of cryogen-free cryocoolers, boosted by their easy-to-use and continuous operation without the need of liquid helium whose cost and scarcity globally increase. Thanks to their large sample space and cooling power, they can host a superconducting magnet and are an adapted platform for quantum technologies, material science, low temperature detectors and even medical fields. The drawback is that this type of system is inherently based on gas compression that induces a certain level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, which can potentially prevent the determination of low amplitude signals or spoil their stability. In this paper we demonstrate that pulse-tube based cryocoolers can be used for electrical precision measurements, using a commercial cryomagnetic system combined with our home-made a coaxial cryoprobe. In particular, parts-per-billion level of measurement uncertainties in resistance determination, based on quantum Hall resistance standards, is achievable at the level of state-of-the-art measurements involving conventional cryostats based on liquid helium. We performed an extensive characterization of the cryomagnetic system to determine the level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, and revealed that although the magnetic field has a drastic effect on the noise level, only marginal interplays on the measurement are observed as long as the working frequencies of the instrumentation are not in the vicinity of the ones of the perturbations. The set of characterization measurements presented here are easily implementable in laboratories, which can help to determine the vibrations and electromagnetic pollution generated by any cryocooler.",

    "title": "Development of Deep Neural Network First-Level Hardware Track Trigger   for the Belle II Experiment",
    "abstract": "The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB accelerator is designed to explore physics beyond the Standard Model with unprecedented luminosity. As the beam intensity increased, the experiment faced significant challenges due to higher beam-induced background, leading to a high trigger rate and placing limitations on further luminosity increases. To address this problem, we developed trigger logic for tracking using deep neural network (DNN) technology on an FPGA for the Belle II hardware trigger system, employing high-level synthesis techniques. By leveraging drift time and hit pattern information from the Central Drift Chamber and incorporating a simplified self-attention architecture, the DNN track trigger significantly improves track reconstruction performance at the hardware level. Compared to the existing neural track trigger, our implementation reduces the total track trigger rate by 37% while improving average efficiency for the signal tracks from 96% to 98% for charged tracks with transverse momentum > 0.3 GeV. This upgrade ensures the long-term viability of the Belle II data acquisition system as luminosity continues to increase.",

    "title": "Plasma Position Constrained Free-Boundary MHD Equilibrium in Tokamaks   using pyIPREQ",
    "abstract": "A free-boundary, axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium code, pyIPREQ, has been developed for Tokamak plasmas using finite difference and Green's function approach. The code builds upon the foundational frameworks of the PEST and IPREQ codes, introducing several enhancements and new capabilities. Notably, pyIPREQ supports the specification of limiter boundaries and enables the computation of key physical quantities. The code has also been extended to compute equilibria constrained by a prescribed magnetic axis position, which is particularly useful when such information can be inferred from the diagnostics data. In addition, pyIPREQ includes functionality to address vertical instabilities, a requirement for accurately modeling elongated plasma configurations. Benchmarking has been carried out against published results and the original IPREQ code. Applications are demonstrated for ADITYA-U Tokamak experiments, where magnetic axis measurements are available, and predictions are also made for SST-1 and ADITYA-U Tokamaks under various operational scenarios.",

    "title": "Holographic Gaseous Lenses for High-Power Lasers",
    "abstract": "The capabilities of the world's highest energy and peak-power pulsed lasers are limited by optical damage, and further advances in high-intensity laser science will require optics that are substantially more robust than existing components. We describe here the experimental demonstration of off-axis diffractive gaseous lenses capable of withstanding extreme laser fluence and immune to cumulative damage. We used less than 8 mJ of energy from interfering ultraviolet laser pulses to holographically write millimeter-scale diffractive gas lenses into an ozone, oxygen, and carbon-dioxide gas mixture. These lenses allowed us to focus, defocus, and collimate 532-nm nanosecond laser pulses with up to 210 mJ of energy at efficiencies above 50% and fluences up to 35 J/cm$^2$. We also show that the gas lenses have sufficient bandwidth to efficiently diffract 35-fs 800-nm pulses and that beam pointing, divergence, and diffraction efficiency are stable while operating at 10 Hz. These diffractive lenses are simple holograms, and the principles demonstrated here could be extended to other types of optics, suggesting that gaseous optics may enable arbitrary, damage-resistant manipulation of intense light for next-generation ultra-high-power lasers.",

    "title": "Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\\sim0.1\\,$second Lifetime",
    "abstract": "We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\\rm int} \\gtrsim 3\\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\\tau_{\\rm int}\\sim90\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.",

    "abstract": "Si-PIN detectors can be microstructured to achieve angular-selective particle detection capabilities, which we call active Transverse Energy Filter (aTEF). The microstructuring consists of a honeycomb structure of deep hexagonally-shaped holes with active silicon side walls, while the bottom of the holes is made insensitive to ionizing radiation. The motivation for this kind of detector arises from the need to distinguish background electrons from signal electrons in a spectrometer of MAC-E filter type. We have demonstrated the angular-dependent detection efficiency of self-fabricated aTEF prototypes in a test setup using an angular-selective photoelectron source to illuminate the detector from various incidence angles.",
