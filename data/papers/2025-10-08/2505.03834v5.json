  "title": "Continuing progress toward fusion energy breakeven and gain as measured   against the Lawson criteria",
  "abstract": "This paper is an update to our earlier paper ''Progress toward fusion energy breakeven and gain as measured against the Lawson criterion'' [Phys. Plasmas 29, 062103 (2022)]. Plots of Lawson parameter and triple product vs. ion temperature and triple product vs. date achieved are updated with recently published experimental results. A new plot of scientific energy gain vs. date achieved is included. Additionally, notes on new experimental results, clarifications, and a correction are included.",
