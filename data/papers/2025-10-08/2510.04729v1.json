  "title": "An Approach for Restoring Magnetic Field Uniformity in Openable   BIPM-Type Kibble Balance Magnets",
  "abstract": "The Kibble balance realizes the kilogram by linking mechanical and electrical quantities via a magnet system. In an improved BIPM-type magnet design by Tsinghua University, an open/close surface was incorporated, facilitating operation. However, an unavoidable mechanical air gap at the splitting plane introduces asymmetry in the magnetic flux density profile, degrading field uniformity. This study proposes a two-step yoke compensation method to restore symmetry by adjusting the upper outer yoke's inner radius and the splitting gap height. Finite element simulations show linear relationships between asymmetry and these parameters, enabling predictive compensation. Experimental results confirm that sequential tuning successfully eliminates asymmetry and recovers the designed uniform field range. The method provides an effective solution for enhancing magnetic field quality in openable Kibble balance magnets.",
