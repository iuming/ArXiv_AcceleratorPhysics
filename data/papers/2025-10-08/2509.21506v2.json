  "title": "Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I. Langmuir   waves",
  "abstract": "Plasmas in various astrophysical systems are in non-equilibrium states as evidenced by direct in-situ measurements in the solar wind, solar corona and planetary environments as well as by indirect observations of various sources of waves and emissions in astrophysical systems. Specific are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, for whose description the most-used are the Kappa (power-law) distributions. With this paper we introduce a modeling alternative for linear waves in plasmas described by another non-equilibrium model, namely the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution. This can reproduce not only high-energy tails, but also low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons associated with the Earth's bow shock and interplanetary shocks or of electrons in the solar transition region. We derive the corresponding dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in terms of the newly introduced Druyvsteyn dispersion function, numerically compute, for the isotropic case, the dispersion curves as well as damping rates, and provide analytical approximation in the limit of weak damping. Thereby, we provide a new modeling tool that facilitates the quantitative treatment of a variety of non-Maxwellian plasmas.",
