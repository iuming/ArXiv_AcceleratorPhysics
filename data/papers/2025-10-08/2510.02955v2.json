  "title": "On the existence of fibered three-dimensional perfect fluid equilibria   without continuous Euclidean symmetry",
  "abstract": "Following Lortz, we construct a family of smooth steady states of the ideal, incompressible Euler equation in three dimensions that possess no continuous Euclidean symmetry. As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.",
