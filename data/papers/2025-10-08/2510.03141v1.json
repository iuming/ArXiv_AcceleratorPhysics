  "title": "Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear   flows",
  "abstract": "In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that fluctuations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfv\\'enic, suggesting that shear-driven turbulence is possible even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.",
