  "title": "Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\\sim0.1\\,$second Lifetime",
  "abstract": "We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\\rm int} \\gtrsim 3\\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\\tau_{\\rm int}\\sim90\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.",
