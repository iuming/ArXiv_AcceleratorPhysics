  "title": "Next Generation Ta-STJ Sensor Arrays for BSM Physics Searches",
  "abstract": "The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST) experiment uses superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors to search for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) with recoil spectroscopy of the $\\mathbf{^7}$Be EC decay into $\\mathbf{^7}$Li. A pulsed UV laser is used to calibrate the STJs throughout the experiment with $\\sim$20 meV precision. Phase-III of the BeEST experiment revealed a systematic calibration discrepancy between STJs. We found these artifacts to be caused by resistive crosstalk and by intensity variations of the calibration laser. For phase-IV of the BeEST experiment, we have removed the crosstalk by designing the STJ array so that each pixel has its own ground wire. We now also use a more stable UV laser for calibration. The new STJ arrays were fabricated at STAR Cryoelectronics and tested at LLNL and FRIB. They have the same high energy resolution of $\\sim$1\\textendash2~eV in the energy range of interest below 100~eV as before, and they no longer exhibit the earlier calibration artifacts. We discuss the design changes and the STJ array performance for the next phase of the BeEST experiment.",
