  "title": "Scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes for   ultrafast timing over keV-GeV energy scales",
  "abstract": "Precise measurement of radiation has long played a vital role in a wide range of research and industrial fields, from fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model to medical imaging such as time-of-flight positron emission tomography. Developing radiation detectors that achieve high timing precision-on the order of a few tens of picoseconds-and energy measurement capabilities remains indispensable yet challenging. In this study, we developed two types of scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (SCI-IMPs), one incorporating barium fluoride, and the other bismuth germanate, to enable simultaneous high-precision timing and energy measurements. To evaluate their performance over a wide energy range from keV- to GeV-scale, electron-positron annihilation gamma rays and cosmic ray muons were used. For energy measurements, both detectors achieved an energy resolution of approximately 35% at 511 keV. For timing measurements using 511 keV, coincidence time resolutions (CTRs) of approximately 50 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) were obtained for both detectors. In contrast, for cosmic ray muon experiments where cosmic ray muon energy is typically on the order of GeV, CTRs were measured to be 25.1 and 16.8 ps FWHM for barium fluoride- and bismuth germanate-based detectors, respectively. The versatile scintillator-integration technique established in this study can broaden the applicability of the newly developed SCI-IMPs. In particular, these results demonstrate that the developed detectors push the boundaries of timing performance while retaining energy measurement and hold promise for future applications in fundamental physics experiments and medical imaging.",
