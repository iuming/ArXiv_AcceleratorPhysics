  "title": "Installation and first commissioning results of the JEF lead tungstate   calorimeter",
  "abstract": "The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL), consisting of 1,596 lead tungstate scintillating crystals, has been recently constructed and installed in Experimental Hall D at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The calorimeter is a key component of the JLab Eta Factory Experiment, whose main goal is to measure the decays of eta and eta prime mesons into multi-photon final states. The ECAL replaces the inner part of the former forward lead-glass calorimeter. Scintillation light from each crystal is detected using Hamamatsu R4125 photomultiplier tubes. Calorimeter modules were fabricated and tested in the lab using light from light-emitting diodes before being installed in the detector frame. The detector is currently undergoing commissioning using the light monitoring system and cosmic rays. We will present an overview of the fabrication and testing of the calorimete modules, along with the first detector commissioning results. The ECAL was ready for data-taking in spring 2025.",
