  "title": "A Novel, Steerable, Low-Energy Proton Source for Detector   Characterization",
  "abstract": "We report on the conversion of the Manitoba II mass spectrometer into a versatile proton beam facility. This infrastruc- ture is adaptable to any detector-under-test (DUT), and has proven itself effective with the characterization of silicon detectors used in subatomic beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) searches. This work discusses the modifications and subsequent tests to confirm the beam specifications met the demands of the aforementioned detectors.",
