  "title": "An active Transverse Energy Filter based on microstructured Si-PIN   diodes with an angular-selective detection efficiency",
  "abstract": "Si-PIN detectors can be microstructured to achieve angular-selective particle detection capabilities, which we call active Transverse Energy Filter (aTEF). The microstructuring consists of a honeycomb structure of deep hexagonally-shaped holes with active silicon side walls, while the bottom of the holes is made insensitive to ionizing radiation. The motivation for this kind of detector arises from the need to distinguish background electrons from signal electrons in a spectrometer of MAC-E filter type. We have demonstrated the angular-dependent detection efficiency of self-fabricated aTEF prototypes in a test setup using an angular-selective photoelectron source to illuminate the detector from various incidence angles.",
