  "title": "Beam-dust interactions in an e$^+$e$^-$ collider",
  "abstract": "In recent electron-positron colliders designed and operated with very low emittance and high current, the energy density of the beam has increased significantly compared to earlier designs. Under these conditions, interactions between the beam and residual materials within the beam pipe exert considerable mutual influence. The residual materials are heated by the beam, leading to evaporation, charging, and possible fission, eventually resulting in a plasma state. Conversely, the beam undergoes emittance growth due to electromagnetic interactions with the resulting plasma. We investigate the effects of such dust-induced plasma on the beam through numerical simulations of these processes.",
