  "title": "Characterisation of Thick Gaseous Electron Multipliers as charge readout   operated in pure argon",
  "abstract": "The gain measurements of several 1 mm-thick, 10$\\times$10 cm$^2$ Thick Gaseous Electron Multipliers (ThGEMs), operated in pure argon at 3.3 bar and room temperature are presented. Electrostatic simulations, performed with the COMSOL MultiPhysics software, were employed to guide the design of the detectors, and the field configurations are discussed. A modified ThGEM design, incorporating two embedded internal electrodes in addition to the conventional top and bottom electrodes, was developed to mitigate discharge-induced instabilities and to enable operation at higher gains. Several such structures were produced and compared to the standard 1 mm-thick two-electrode ThGEM. Gain measurements were conducted for every design described here over a wide range of applied electric fields and up to large values. The experimental setup and measurement methodology are described, alongside a comparative analysis of the performance of the different detector geometries.",
