  "title": "Evaluation of the absolute single-photon detection efficiency of HRPPD",
  "abstract": "Pixelated High Rate Picosecond Photon Detectors (HRPPDs) by Incom Inc. are promising photosensors for use in Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detectors, where a high gain, sub-mm position resolution and sub-100ps timing resolution are required in a single photon mode. Quantum Efficiency (QE) has been measured for the first batch of EIC HRPPDs both by Incom and EIC research groups at Jefferson Lab and Brookhaven Lab, with peak values at $\\sim$365 nm typically exceeding 30%. In this study, we present a first direct measurement of Photon Detection Efficiency being equal to (17.1 $\\pm$ 0.1 [stat] $\\pm$ 0.3 [sys])% at 398.6 nm, for a pixel near the center of HRPPD, in a photoelectron pulse counting mode using a picosecond diode laser. HRPPD QE at the same spot and at the same wavelength was evaluated to be (24.4 $\\pm$ 0.1 [stat] $\\pm$ 0.3 [sys])%, leading to a Collection Efficiency estimate of (70.3 $\\pm$ 1.6)%, which is consistent with the expectations.",
