  "title": "Acceleration gradients in dielectric laser accelerators with   triangular-shaped gratings",
  "abstract": "The study investigated transparent on-chip structures with a rectangular profile and triangular profiles with grating ridge base angles of $\\alpha = 36^\\circ$, $30^\\circ$, and $20^\\circ$. Each triangular structure had both left- and right-handed profile orientations. For all variants, a modified version with a reflective gold coating was additionally considered. The maximum energy gains and accelerating gradients were determined and quantified for all structure classes: transparent and reflective (with both rectangular and triangular profiles).",
