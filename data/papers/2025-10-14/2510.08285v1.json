  "title": "Simulation of the thermoelectric effect in a multi-metallic   superconducting cavity",
  "abstract": "Superconducting radio frequency accelerating cavities made with different material layers, such as copper, Nb or Nb3Sn, are susceptible to thermoelectric effects due to differences in Seebeck coefficients between the metals. A temperature gradient across the surfaces can drive thermoelectric currents, which may impact the cavity performance. A layered Cu/Nb/Nb3Sn single cell cavity was tested with cryocoolers in 2022. Three heaters were mounted on the cavity surface at different locations and three single axis cryogenic fluxgate magnetometers were attached close to the cavity equator. A linear increase in the magnetic field was measured while increasing the heaters power. The cavity setup was analysed with COMSOL and the results showed a trend similar to that observed in the experiment. This contribution details the approach chosen for the simulation and some of the challenges encountered.",
