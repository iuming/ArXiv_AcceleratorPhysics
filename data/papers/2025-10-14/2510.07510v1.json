  "title": "Efficient Radiofrequency Sensing with Fluorescence Encoding",
  "abstract": "Optically-active spin qubits have emerged as powerful quantum sensors capable of nanoscale magnetometry, yet conventional coherent sensing approaches are ultimately limited by the coherence time of the sensor, typically precluding detection in the sub-MHz regime. We present a broadly applicable fluorescence-encoding method that circumvents coherence-time constraints by transducing time-varying magnetic fields directly into modulated fluorescence signals. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a model system, we demonstrate shot-noise-limited sensitivity for AC magnetic fields spanning near-DC to MHz frequencies, with detection bandwidth tunable via optical excitation power. The technique captures complete spectral information in a single measurement, eliminating the need for point-by-point frequency scanning, and allows phase-sensitive multi-frequency detection with Hz-level resolution. This approach transforms quantum sensors into atomic-scale spectrum analyzers, with immediate applications for low-frequency RF communication, zero-field NMR, and bioelectronic sensing. Our approach is broadly applicable to the expanding class of optically-active spin qubits, including molecular systems and fluorescent proteins, opening new sensing regimes previously inaccessible to coherent techniques",
