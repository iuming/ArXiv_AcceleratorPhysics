  "title": "Comparison of MHD and gyrokinetic simulations of linear instabilities at   the q = 1 surface",
  "abstract": "Accurate modeling of core instabilities in tokamak plasmas is essential to understand the underlying physical mechanisms and their impact on plasma confinement. The ideal stability of the internal kink mode and the m = 1 collisionless tearing mode are analyzed numerically both with gyrokinetic and MHD codes. We compare the different models implemented in the codes and show that the gyrokinetic equations without collisions inherently contain the ideal MHD limit. The simulation results show that the stability of the internal kink mode strongly depends on the choice of several setup parameters like the inclusion of parallel magnetic field fluctuations, the tokamak aspect ratio, the drift- or gyrokinetic treatment of the ions and the electron mass. Furthermore, we demonstrate the stabilization of the instabilities by diamagnetic effects. Our results indicate that gyrokinetic and MHD models can be reconciled in the description of the internal kink mode by careful consideration of the simulation setup and model assumptions, but instabilities like the collisionless tearing mode require a more advanced treatment beyond MHD.",
