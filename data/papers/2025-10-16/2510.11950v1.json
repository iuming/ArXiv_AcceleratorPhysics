  "title": "Digital Low-Level RF system for the Linac Electronics Modernization Plan   at LCLS",
  "abstract": "The LCLS began operations in 2009, utilizing SLAC's normal-conducting (NC) LINAC, which features control equipment dating back to the 1960s and 1980s. The Linac Electronics Modernization Plan (LEMP) aims to replace the legacy control equipment with a system based on the open-source Marble carrier board and Zest+ digitizer board, both of which are used in the LCLS-II HE LLRF system. Adaptation of the LLRF system developed for the continuous-wave (CW) superconducting RF (SRF) LCLS-II to the short-RF pulse NC LCLS includes leveraging the knowledge and experience gained from recent LLRF projects at SLAC and efficiently reusing the core functionality of the hardware and code base developed for previous projects, in collaboration with LBNL, FNAL and JLAB. A prototype has been deployed and tested at station 26-3, demonstrating RF generation/control, interlocks, triggers, and waveform capture. Here, we describe the hardware, firmware and software infrastructure, highlight key features, and present initial test results.",
