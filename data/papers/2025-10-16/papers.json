    "title": "Long Living Hot and Dense Plasma from Relativistic Laser-Nanowire Array   Interaction",
    "abstract": "Long-living, hot and dense plasmas generated by ultra-intense laser beams are of critical importance for laser-driven nuclear physics, bright hard X-ray sources, and laboratory astrophysics. We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.",

    "title": "Investigating Solid-Fluid Phase Coexistence in DC Plasma Bilayer   Crystals: The Role of Particle Pairing and Mode Coupling",
    "abstract": "This article presents a detailed investigation of solid-fluid phase coexistence in a bilayer dusty plasma crystal subjected to varying confinement ring bias voltages in a DC glow discharge argon plasma. Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged: it is characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and non-reciprocal interactions play a pivotal role in destabilizing the bilayer structure. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.",

    "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate a method for reconstructing the transverse 4D phase space of an electron beam at the time of emission from downstream diagnostics of the 4D phase space. This method does not rely on detailed knowledge of the beamline transport, besides assuming that linearity and symplecticity are satisfied. We apply this method to measure the transverse position and momentum phase space of electrons emitted from a spatially-structured alkali-antimonide cathode. This method can uncover local correlations between emission location and momentum spread. We formulate this method analytically and investigate resolution limits.",

    "title": "Unlocking New Frontiers: The Versatile Potential of the Brazilian   Multipurpose Reactor",
    "abstract": "The multipurpose nature of nuclear research reactors has been investigated. This class of reactors has gained momentum within the international community, given the multiple benefits of nuclear technology in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the development of new materials, being characterized by the simultaneous use of several applications. In this context, Brazil has recently joined the group of countries with multipurpose reactor projects. The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) will be Brazil's new neutron source, with a thermal power of $30$ $MW$, with a core flux on the order of $\\phi=4\\times 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$ and a power density of $312.5$ $W/cm^3$, ensuring the production of radioisotopes, material and fuel irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In this work, the demand for neutron fluxes in different irradiation targets is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations under a perturbation caused by a highly neutron-absorbing material, the Gadolinium-157 (Gd-157) isotope. The results show that Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) production is not affected by the Gd-157 target, and the minimum proposed thermal neutron flux for the reactor's activity ($\\phi_{min}=5.1\\times 10^{12}$ $n/cm^{2}s$) is guaranteed even at maximum operational capacity. The potential production of Terbium (Tb) isotopes for nuclear medicine applications in the RMB is briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Attosecond X-ray pulses are a critical tool for tracking ultrafast electron dynamics in condensed matter, molecular systems, and strongly correlated materials. Recent breakthroughs have pushed X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) into the attosecond domain, significantly surpassing their previous femtosecond capabilities. Building on these advancements, this work investigates the potential of the Shanghai High Repetition Rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility (SHINE), China's first continuous-wave (CW) XFEL, to generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses, thereby offering transformative capabilities for X-ray science. Through comprehensive start-to-end simulations, we show that SHINE is capable of producing hard X-ray pulses with peak powers reaching the terawatt-scale and average pulse durations of approximately 300 as. This is achieved using a self-chirping scheme within the existing machine configuration, requiring no additional hardware. Our findings demonstrate that CW XFELs can generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses at megahertz repetition rates, opening new opportunities for real-time studies of electronic dynamics in complex systems.",

Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Our design employs two kg-scale gold-platinum test masses which, unlike in the LPF, are surrounded by a shield below 1 K and positioned side-by-side with a centimeter-scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. To estimate the integration time required for GIE detection, we simulate quantum measurements of these modes, considering noise sources such as gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.",

    "title": "Towards polarization-enhanced PET: Study of random background in   polarization-correlated Compton events",
    "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality that utilizes positron-emitting isotopes, such as Ga-68 and F-18, for many diagnostic purposes. The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\\pm$90$^{\\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\\sim$200 MBq to $\\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements. We find that the signal-to-random background ratios (SBRs) obtained from the polarization-correlated events for Compton scattering angles $\\theta_{1,2}\\in[72^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}]$ and azimuthal angle difference $\\Delta\\phi=90^{\\circ}\\pm20^{\\circ}$ are consistently higher than those from single-pixel events, with the ratio of their SBR values of 1.23. The SBR of the selected events also increases with the polarimetric modulation factor $\\mu$, gaining $\\sim$50\\% in value during the experiment.",

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of core instabilities in tokamak plasmas is essential to understand the underlying physical mechanisms and their impact on plasma confinement. The ideal stability of the internal kink mode and the m = 1 collisionless tearing mode are analyzed numerically both with gyrokinetic and MHD codes. We compare the different models implemented in the codes and show that the gyrokinetic equations without collisions inherently contain the ideal MHD limit. The simulation results show that the stability of the internal kink mode strongly depends on the choice of several setup parameters like the inclusion of parallel magnetic field fluctuations, the tokamak aspect ratio, the drift- or gyrokinetic treatment of the ions and the electron mass. Furthermore, we demonstrate the stabilization of the instabilities by diamagnetic effects. Our results indicate that gyrokinetic and MHD models can be reconciled in the description of the internal kink mode by careful consideration of the simulation setup and model assumptions, but instabilities like the collisionless tearing mode require a more advanced treatment beyond MHD.",

    "abstract": "High-power multi-color terahertz (THz) radiation exhibits extraordinary scientific application prospects at various scientific frontiers, for its capacity to deliver THz excitation at multiple frequencies simultaneously. However, the generation of high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequencies remains a challenge for existing techniques. Here, a technique by combining the multi-laser pulses frequency beating and coherent undulator amplification is proposed for generating high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequency. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed technique can produce multi-color THz radiation with three to six distinguished colors and a peak power up to hundreds of MW, and the temporally separated two-color pulses can also be produced by employing undulators with different resonance. Due to the intrinsic properties of the proposed technique, the THz frequencies, the color number and the frequency interval can be effectively controlled by simply adjusting the beating laser. This method paves the way for advanced application of THz pump-THz probe experiments for selective excitation of atomic multi-level systems and molecular fingerprint recognition.",

Both were observed in an intense non-uniform electric field in the vicinity of 2-$\\mu$m narrow anode strips deposited, with a 2~mm pitch, on a semiconductive glass substrate (S8900), with a cathode film on its backside. An initial light yield of $\\sim$460 VUV photons per drifting electron was measured, which degraded within tens of minutes stabilizing at (27.0~$\\pm$~3.1)~photons per electron. The electroluminescence was accompanied by electron multiplication with an estimated charge gain $<$10.

    "abstract": "Improving the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) systems to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain or even direct positron emission imaging (dPEI) is of paramount importance for many advanced new clinical applications of PET imaging. This places higher demands on the timing performance of all aspects of PET systems. One effective approach is to use microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs) for prompt Cherenkov photon detection. In this study, we developed a dual-module Cherenkov PET imaging experimental platform, utilising our proprietary 8 * 8-anode Cherenkov radiator-integrated window MCP-PMTs in combination with custom-designed multi-channel electronics, and designed a specific calibration and correction method for the platform. Using this platform, a CTR of 103 ps FWHM was achieved. We overcame the limitations of single-anode detectors in previous experiments, significantly enhanced imaging efficiency and achieved module-level Cherenkov PET imaging for the first time. Imaging experiments involving radioactive sources and phantoms of various shapes and types were conducted, which preliminarily validated the feasibility and advancement of this imaging method. In addition, the effects of normalisation correction and the interaction probability between the gamma rays and the MCP on the images and experimental results were analysed and verified.",

    "abstract": "Independent control of numerous electrodes in quantum charge-coupled device architectures presents a significant challenge for wiring and hardware scalability. To address this issue, we demonstrate a voltage control method based on time-division multiplexing (TDM). This approach utilizes a single high-update-rate digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to sequentially generate control signals for multiple electrodes, thereby reducing both the number of required DACs and associated wiring. We experimentally validate this concept by developing a 10-channel system that operates with only two DACs. The developed TDM-based voltage control system is applied to a surface-electrode trap, where we successfully trap a single $^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion and demonstrate a simple ion transport primitive. This approach offers a resource-efficient and scalable solution for advanced quantum computing systems based on trapped ions.",

    "title": "Polar Filaments Capture High Latitude Solar Poloidal Field Interactions   and can Foretell the Future Sunspot Cycle Amplitude before Polar Field   Precursors",
    "abstract": "Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.",

A key factor contributing to this complexity is the presence of Alfv\\'en waves, which critically influences the character of the flow and makes the problem considerably more challenging. Within the framework where the magnetic field is everywhere parallel to the flow velocity, we give an effective decomposition of the steady MHD equations in terms of the deformation tensor and the modified vorticity, where the modification in the vorticity is to record the effect of the Lorentz force on the velocity field. The existence and structural stability of the super-Alfv\\'{e}nic cylindrical transonic shock solutions for the steady MHD equations are established under three-dimensional perturbations of the incoming flow and the exit total pressure (kinetic plus magnetic).",

This approach accurately reproduces the experimental results for both PTCDA/Ag(111) and 1,5,9-trioxo-13-azatriangulene (TOAT)/Cu(111) systems, including intricate tip-sample distance-dependent features.

    "title": "Optimal and efficient inference tools for field tracking with precessing   spins",
    "abstract": "Precise, real-time monitoring of magnetic field evolution is important in applications including magnetic navigation and searches for physics beyond the standard model. One main field-monitoring technique, the spin-precession magnetometer (SPM), observes electron, nucleus, color center, or muon spins as they precess in response to their local magnetic field. Here, we study Bayesian signal-recovery methods for SPMs in the free-induction decay (FID) mode. In particular, we study tracking of field changes well within the coherence time of the spin system, and thus well beyond the response bandwidth, as in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 040503 (2018)]. We derive the Bayesian Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound that dictates the ultimate precision in estimating the Larmor frequency, which we show to be attained by the computationally-expensive prediction error method (PEM). Relative to this benchmark, we show that the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) offer near-optimal tracking that is also computationally efficient, with the use of the latter giving better results only for large spin number. Focusing thus on the EKF, we show that it is sufficient to accurately track fluctuating and unknown transient signals. Our methods can be easily adapted to other types of sensors undergoing non-linear dissipative dynamics and experiencing intrinsic Gaussian-like stochastic noises.",

    "title": "Towards fully predictive gyrokinetic full-f simulations",
    "abstract": "Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak \\`{a} Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \\times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.",

    "abstract": "The low relative charge-to-mass ratio offset of 0.065% between fully ionized helium-4 and carbon-12 ions enables simultaneous acceleration in hadron therapy synchrotrons. At the same energy per mass, helium ions exhibit a stopping range approximately three times greater than carbon ions. They can therefore be exploited for online range verification downstream of the patient during carbon ion beam irradiation. One possibility for creating this mixed beam is accelerating the two ion species sequentially through the LINAC and subsequently \"mixing\" them at injection energy in the synchrotron with a double multi-turn injection scheme. This work reports the first successful generation, acceleration, and extraction of a mixed helium and carbon ion beam using this double multi-turn injection scheme, which was achieved at the MedAustron therapy accelerator in Austria. A description of the double multi-turn injection scheme, particle tracking simulations, and details on the implementation at the MedAustron accelerator facility are presented and discussed. Finally, measurements of the mixed beam at delivery in the irradiation room using a radiochromic film and a low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) detector are presented.",

Among these advancements, the Timepix3 hybrid-pixel direct electron detector stands out for its unique ability to output temporal information about individual hits within its pixel array. Its event-based architecture enables data-driven detection, where individual events are immediately read out from the chip. While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of event-based detectors in various applications in the context of continuous-gun scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM), the use of such detectors with standard scanning units remains underdeveloped. In this work, we present a custom-designed, Timepix3-compatible scanning unit specifically developed to leverage the advantages of event-based detection. We explore its performance in enabling spatially and temporally resolved experiments, as well as its seamless interfacing with other time-resolved instruments, such as pulsed lasers and electron beam blankers. Additionally, we examine the prospects for achieving enhanced temporal resolution in time-resolved experiments using continuous-gun electron microscopes, identifying key challenges and proposing solutions to improve performance.

    "abstract": "We present a simplified approach enforcing energy conservation to incorporate the effects of zonal modes alongside wave-particle nonlinearities in the determination of the saturation amplitude. The model assumes that the zonal perturbations grow at a rate twice that of the original (pump) wave, consistent with a beat-driven (or force-driven) generation mechanism. The evolution and saturation of the mode amplitude are investigated both analytically and numerically within our reduced model assumptions, in both the collisionless and scattering-dominated regimes. These studies underscore the crucial role of sources and sinks in accurately capturing the impact and the role of beat-driven zonal perturbations on mode evolution. In the realistic case of saturation set by sources and sinks, we discuss the role of a finite amplitude zonal mode in reducing microturbulent particle scattering, thus limiting the energy source for the resonant mode. We then discuss comparisons between the model predictions and simulation results. The model reproduces key features observed in gyrokinetic simulations as the reduction in saturated mode amplitude and the onset of wave-wave nonlinear effects as functions of mode growth rate and amplitude. Thanks to its simplicity, it can be readily implemented into codes based on reduced models, thereby improving their predictive capability for strongly driven instabilities.",

    "title": "Optimised neural networks for online processing of ATLAS calorimeter   data on FPGAs",
    "abstract": "A study of neural network architectures for the reconstruction of the energy deposited in the cells of the ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeters under high pile-up conditions expected at the HL-LHC is presented. These networks are designed to run on the FPGA-based readout hardware of the calorimeters under strict size and latency constraints. Several architectures, including Dense, Recurrent (RNN), and Convolutional (CNN) neural networks, are optimised using a Bayesian procedure that balances energy resolution against network size. The optimised Dense, CNN, and combined Dense+RNN architectures achieve a transverse energy resolution of approximately 80 MeV, outperforming both the optimal filtering (OF) method currently in use and RNNs of similar complexity. A detailed comparison across the full dynamic range shows that Dense, CNN, and Dense+RNN accurately reproduce the energy scale, while OF and RNNs underestimate the energy. Deep Evidential Regression is implemented within the Dense architecture to address the need for reliable per-event energy uncertainties. This approach provides predictive uncertainty estimates with minimal increase in network size. The predicted uncertainty is found to be consistent, on average, with the difference between the true deposited energy and the predicted energy.",

    "title": "Characterisation of the first wafer-scale prototype for the ALICE ITS3   upgrade: the monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS)",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the characterisation and testing of the first wafer-scale monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS) prototype developed for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade that is to be installed during the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2030). The MOSS chip design is driven by the truly cylindrical detector geometry that imposes that each layer is built out of two wafer-sized, bent silicon chips. The stitching technique is employed to fabricate sensors with dimensions of 1.4 $\\times$ 25.9 cm, thinned to 50 $\\mu$m. The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements. The MOSS chip demonstrates the feasibility of the ITS3 detector concept and provides insights for further optimisation and development.",

    "title": "Further Characterisation of Digital Pixel Test Structures Implemented in   a 65 nm CMOS Process",
    "abstract": "The next generation of MAPS for future tracking detectors will have to meet stringent requirements placed on them. One such detector is the ALICE ITS3 that aims to be very light at 0.07% X/X$_{0}$ per layer and have a low power consumption in the active area of 40 mW/cm$^{2}$ by implementing wafer-scale MAPS bent into cylindrical half layers. To address these challenging requirements, the ALICE ITS3 project, in conjunction with the CERN EP R&D on monolithic pixel sensors, proposed the Tower Partners Semiconductor Co. 65 nm CMOS process as the starting point for the sensor. After the initial results confirmed the detection efficiency and radiation hardness, the choice of the technology was solidified by demonstrating the feasibility of operating MAPS in low-power consumption regimes, < 50 mW/cm$^{2}$, while maintaining high-quality performance. This was shown through a detailed characterisation of the Digital Pixel Test Structure (DPTS) prototype exposed to X-rays and ionising beams, and the results are presented in this article. Additionally, the sensor was further investigated through studies of the fake-hit rate, the linearity of the front-end in the range 1.7-28 keV, the performance after ionising irradiation, and the detection efficiency of inclined tracks in the range 0-45$^\\circ$.",

    "abstract": "The black holes in the Event Horizon Telescope sources Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) are embedded in a hot, collisionless plasma that is fully described in kinetic theory yet is usually modeled as an ideal, magnetized fluid. In this Letter, we present results from a new set of weakly collisional fluid simulations in which leading order kinetic effects are modeled as viscosity and heat conduction. Consistent with earlier, lower-resolution studies, we find that overall flow dynamics remain very similar between ideal and non-ideal models. For the first time, we synthesize images and spectra of SgrA* from weakly collisional models -- assuming an isotropic, thermal population of electrons -- and find that these remain largely indistinguishable from ideal fluid predictions. However, most weakly collisional models exhibit lower light curve variability, with all magnetically dominated models showing a small but systematic decrease in variability.",

    "title": "In-situ Radiation Damage Study of Silicon Carbide Detectors Subjected to   Clinical Proton Beams",
    "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) planar PiN diodes from two different manufacturers were irradiated with 252.7 MeV protons from a medical synchrotron. Over the course of two 8h irradiation shifts, the samples were exposed to increasing fluences ranging from 1.4e+11 to 3.5e+13 p+/cm^2. Electrical characterizations, including IV and CV measurements, were performed both before and after irradiation using probe stations, and for selected samples even in-situ between fluence steps directly at the irradiation facility. The results show a gradual compensation of the effective epitaxial doping concentration with each incremental fluence step, observed as a reduction in capacitance before full depletion and confirmed by the extracted effective doping concentration. From these measurements, linear donor removal rates are determined for all sample groups, with values ranging from 4.2/cm to 6.4/cm. These findings provide a quantitative basis for understanding radiation-induced charge carrier removal in 4H-SiC devices and are relevant for predicting the performance and lifetime of future radiation-hard detector technologies, including 4H-SiC LGADs.",

    "title": "Machine Learning-Integrated Hybrid Fluid-Kinetic Framework for Quantum   Electrodynamic Laser Plasma Simulations",
    "abstract": "High-intensity laser plasma interactions create complex computational problems because they involve both fluid and kinetic regimes, which need models that maintain physical precision while keeping computational speed. The research introduces a machine learning-based three-dimensional hybrid fluid-particle-in-cell (PIC) system, which links relativistic plasma behavior to automatic regime transitions. The technique employs fluid approximations for stable areas but activates the PIC solver when SwitchNet directs it to unstable sections through its training on physics-based synthetic data. The model uses a smooth transition between Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling and multiphoton ionization rates to simulate ionization, while Airy-function approximations simulate quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects for radiation reaction and pair production. The convolutional neural network applies energy conservation through physics-based loss functions, which operate on normalized fields per channel. Monte Carlo dropout provides uncertainty measurement. The hybrid model produces precise predictions with coefficient of determination (R^2) values above 0.95 and mean squared errors below 10^-4 for all field components. This adaptive approach enhances the accuracy and scalability of laser-plasma simulations, providing a unified predictive framework for high-energy-density and particle acceleration applications.",

A compatibility layer, named ALF IPbus, was created in C++ and integrated with DIM services, allowing for the transparent conversion of SWT frames into IPbus transactions. Benchmark tests indicated median execution times of less than 4.2 $\\mu$s per frame for sequences above 512 words, comfortably meeting the ALICE Detector Control System requirements. Long-term stability tests conducted in the FV0 detector achieved an uptime close to 100\\% from the moment of implementation on the FIT-FV0 detector. This solution enables FIT operation without firmware changes, ensures smooth integration with SCADA systems, and provides a scalable pathway for future migration to GBT-based control.

    "abstract": "Quantum correlations in the polarization degrees of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\\Delta\\hat\\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample -- based on a total of $3 \\times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\\Delta\\hat\\Phi$. The simulated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental correlation spectra and behave as predicted by theory.",

    "title": "Improved Pixel-wise Calibration for Charge-Integrating Hybrid Pixel   Detectors with Performance Validation",
    "abstract": "The M\\\"ONCH hybrid pixel detector, with a 25 \\textmu m pixel pitch and fast charge-integrating readout, has demonstrated subpixel resolution capabilities for X-ray imaging and deep learning-based electron localization in electron microscopy. Fully exploiting this potential requires extensive calibration to ensure both linearity and uniformity of the pixel response, which is challenging for detectors with a large dynamic range. To overcome the limitations of conventional calibration methods, we developed an accurate and efficient correction method to achieve pixel-wise gain and nonlinearity calibration based on the backside pulsing technique. A three-dimensional lookup table was generated for all pixels across the full dynamic range, mapping the pixel response to a calibrated linear energy scale. Compared with conventional linear calibration, the proposed method yields negligible deviations between the calibrated and nominal energies for photons and electrons. The improvement in energy resolution ranges from 4% to 22% for 15-25 keV photons and from 16% to 23% for 60-200 keV electrons. Deep learning-based electron localization demonstrates a 4% improvement in spatial resolution when using the proposed calibration method. This approach further enables rapid diagnosis of the cause of bad pixels and estimation of bump-bonding yield.",

    "title": "Realizing the Scientific Program with Polarized Ion Beams at EIC",
    "abstract": "Polarized ion beams at the Electron Ion Collider are essential to address some of the most important open questions at the twenty-first century frontiers of understanding of the fundamental structure of matter. Here, we summarize the science case and identify polarized $^2$H, $^3$He, $^6$Li and $^7$Li ion beams as critical technology that will enable experiments which address the most important science. Further, we discuss the required ion polarimetry and spin manipulation in EIC. The current EIC accelerator design is presented. We identify a significant R\\&D effort involving both national laboratories and universities that is required over about a decade to realize the polarized ion beams and estimate (based on previous experience) that it will require about 20 FTE over 10 years (or a total of about 200 FTE-years) of personnel, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, technicians and engineers. Attracting, educating and training a new generation of physicists in experimental spin techniques will be essential for successful realization. AI/ML is seen as having significant potential for both acceleration of R\\&D and amplification of discovery in optimal realization of this unique quantum technology on a cutting-edge collider. The R\\&D effort is synergistic with research in atomic physics and fusion energy science.",

    "abstract": "The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating & Python (a free, open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.",

This paper highlights their performance on simulated events, and summarizes novel calibration techniques using proton-proton collision data collected at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV during the 2016$-$2018 LHC data-taking period. Three dedicated methods are used for the calibration in multijet events, leveraging either machine learning techniques, the presence of muons within energetic boosted jets, or the reconstruction of hadronically decaying high-energy Z bosons.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the thermal and electrical conductivities of materials under extremely high temperatures is essential in high-energy-density physics. These properties govern processes such as stellar core dynamics, planetary magnetic field generation, and laser-driven plasma evolution. However, first-principles methods like Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) face challenges in predicting these properties due to prohibitively high computational costs. We propose a scheme that integrates the Kubo formalism with a mixed stochastic-deterministic DFT (mDFT) method, which substantially enhances efficiency in computing thermal and electrical conductivities of dense plasmas under extremely high temperatures. As a showcase, this approach enables {\\it ab initio} calculations of the thermal and electrical conductivities of Aluminum (Al) up to 1000 eV. Compared to traditional transport models, our first-principles results reveal significant deviations in the thermal and electrical conductivities of Al within the warm dense matter regime, underscoring the importance of accounting for quantum effects when investigating these transport properties of warm dense matter.",

Here we present simulation results to assess the effects of magnetic fields on two spectrometer configurations using a two-layered tracking scheme for the incoming and outgoing particles. At a low magnetic field of up to ~50 mT, the tracking and reconstruction accuracy is only minimally influenced. Beyond a magnetic field of ~80 mT the tracking capabilities diminish significantly. Operating a two-layered scheme using small magnetic fields hence does not require adaptations. Only at large magnetic fields, a tracking scheme that makes use of an accurate field map or the use of at least three layers must be employed to achieve reliable particle tracking.",

The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.27 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.55 to 1.4 ns in the single-photon regime with intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, pixel count, and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and time-walk, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.",

In this work, single devices and arrays of 3D sensors based on 30 $\\mu$m epitaxial silicon wafer have been designed, simulated, fabricated, and tested. This process was developed on the 8-inch CMOS process platform of the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS). The key processes include Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) with the Bosch process, in-situ doping, and an innovative back-etching. After testing the 3D pixel sensors, we have summarized the leakage current and capacitance of devices with different sizes with respect to bias voltages. We also found that the fabricated devices were almost all successfully produced, which laid a strong foundation for subsequent large-scale mass production.",

    "title": "Studying the properties of reconnection-driven turbulence",
    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection, often accompanied by turbulence interaction, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical environments. However, the current understanding of the nature of turbulent magnetic reconnection remains insufficient. We investigate the statistical properties of reconnection turbulence in the framework of the self-driven reconnection. Using the open-source software package AMUN, we first perform numerical simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection. We then obtain the statistical results of reconnection turbulence by traditional statistical methods such as the power spectrum and structure function. Our numerical results demonstrate: (1) the velocity spectrum of reconnection turbulence follows the classical Kolmogorov type of $E\\propto k^{-5/3}$, while the magnetic field spectrum is steeper than the Kolmogorov spectrum, which are independent of limited resistivity, guide field, and isothermal or adiabatic fluid states; (2) most of the simulations show the anisotropy cascade, except that the presence of a guide field leads to an isotropic cascade; (3) reconnection turbulence is incompressible in the adiabatic state, with energy distribution dominated by the velocity solenoidal component; (4) different from pure magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the intermittency of the velocity field is stronger than that of the magnetic field in reconnection turbulence. The steep magnetic field spectrum, together with the velocity spectrum of Kolmogorov type, can characterize the feature of the reconnection turbulence. In the case of the presence of the guide field, the isotropy of the reconnection turbulence cascade is also different from the cascade mode of pure MHD turbulence. Our experimental results provide new insights into the properties of reconnection turbulence, which will contribute to advancing the self-driven reconnection theory.",

    "abstract": "Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) has long been recognized as a significant source of longitudinal impedance driving microwave instability in electron storage rings. In the pursuit of higher luminosity, next-generation circular $e^+e^-$ colliders operating in the few-GeV energy range, such as B-factories and Tau-Charm factories, are being designed with low-emittance beams and high beam currents. Damping wigglers are commonly introduced to reduce damping times and control beam emittance. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of coherent wiggler radiation (CWR), a specific form of CSR generated within wigglers, on beam stability in Tau-Charm factories. We revisit the threshold conditions for CWR-induced microwave instability and evaluate its effects under realistic lattice configurations of collider rings. Furthermore, we examine theoretical models of longitudinal CWR impedance and identify improved formulations that better capture its influence. As an illustrative example, the developed CWR impedance models are applied to simulate beam stability in the Super Tau-Charm Facility currently under design in China.",

    "abstract": "Multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separators and spectrometers (MR-ToF MSs) are indispensable tools at radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities. These electrostatic ion beam traps act as highly selective mass separators and high-precision mass spectrometers for rare and exotic nuclei. When well-tuned and designed to minimize higher-order flight-time aberrations, state-of-the-art MR-ToF MSs approach, and slightly exceed, mass resolving powers of \\( m / \\Delta m = 10^6 \\). Achieving \\( m / \\Delta m > 3 \\cdot 10^6 \\) would provide the ability to resolve \\( >90\\% \\) of all known isomeric states with half-lives above 10~\\text{ms}. However, the ability to mass separate in all practical setups is limited by non-ideal conditions which place such resolving powers out of reach. To this end, we present a simulated analysis of these conditions in the newly proposed high-voltage MR-ToF MS for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). It is expected to store ions at 30~\\text{keV} beam energy and increase ion throughput by two orders of magnitude compared to current devices. Existing efforts to mitigate the effects of non-ideal conditions employed for current MR-ToF devices storing ions at \\( <3~\\text{keV} \\) beam energy will already enable mass resolving powers approaching \\( 10^6 \\) for FRIB's high-voltage MR-ToF device. Simulations of newly proposed mitigation strategies show that even mass resolving powers approaching \\( 10^7 \\) might become feasible.",

Here, we propose a novel design for an injector tailor made for dielectric laser acceleration, based on just-above-threshold ionization of laser-cooled atoms. The key new feature is a an innovative magnet design that avoids apparent emittance growth by using the field-free regions of an axially polarised ring of permanent magnets as source point. We optimized this design using a multi-objective optimization approach that is also applicable to the development of other sub-relativistic, high-brightness/low-emittance electron beam setups (like setups for ultrafast electron diffraction). The expected injected bunch charge of our proposed injector is 90 (60) electrons for a dielectric laser acceleration gradient of 1 GV/m (100MV/m) operating at a 10 micron driver laser wavelength, increasing the expected bunch charge by about two orders of magnitude.",

    "title": "Studies of Hadronic Showers in SND@LHC",
    "abstract": "The SND@LHC experiment was built for observing neutrinos arising from LHC pp collisions. The detector consists of two sections: a target instrumented with SciFi modules and a hadronic calorimeter/muon detector. Energetic $\\nu$N collisions in the target produce hadronic showers. Reconstruction of the shower total energy requires an estimate of the fractions deposited in both the target and the calorimeter. In order to calibrate the SND@LHC response, a replica of the detector was exposed to hadron beams with 100 to 300 GeV in the CERN SPS H8 test beam line in Summer 2023. This report describes the methods developed to tag the presence of a shower, to locate the shower origin in the target, and to combine the target SciFi and the calorimeter signals so to measure the shower total energy.",
