  "title": "A double multi-turn injection scheme for generating mixed helium and   carbon ion beams at medical synchrotron facilities",
  "abstract": "The low relative charge-to-mass ratio offset of 0.065% between fully ionized helium-4 and carbon-12 ions enables simultaneous acceleration in hadron therapy synchrotrons. At the same energy per mass, helium ions exhibit a stopping range approximately three times greater than carbon ions. They can therefore be exploited for online range verification downstream of the patient during carbon ion beam irradiation. One possibility for creating this mixed beam is accelerating the two ion species sequentially through the LINAC and subsequently \"mixing\" them at injection energy in the synchrotron with a double multi-turn injection scheme. This work reports the first successful generation, acceleration, and extraction of a mixed helium and carbon ion beam using this double multi-turn injection scheme, which was achieved at the MedAustron therapy accelerator in Austria. A description of the double multi-turn injection scheme, particle tracking simulations, and details on the implementation at the MedAustron accelerator facility are presented and discussed. Finally, measurements of the mixed beam at delivery in the irradiation room using a radiochromic film and a low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) detector are presented.",
