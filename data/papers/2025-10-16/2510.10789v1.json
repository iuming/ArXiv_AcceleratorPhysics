  "title": "Dual Band Receiver Design for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) Mission",
  "abstract": "A dual band receiver has been designed for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) mission, which is a space Very-Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) mission concept, aimed at unveiling the photon ring of black holes. The cryogenic receiver comprises a 228-320 GHz Superconductor-Insulator Superconductor (SIS) receiver, paired with a 76-106.7 GHz HEMT receiver. The details of the design are described in this talk. A novel comb generator, which will be used for delay tracking, has been designed and tested.",
