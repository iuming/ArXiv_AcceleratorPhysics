  "title": "Electroluminescence and charge multiplication in liquid xenon with a   VCC-like Microstrip Plate",
  "abstract": "We report on the first observation of electroluminescence and charge amplification with a Virtual Cathode Chamber (VCC) microstrips plate immersed in liquid xenon. Both were observed in an intense non-uniform electric field in the vicinity of 2-$\\mu$m narrow anode strips deposited, with a 2~mm pitch, on a semiconductive glass substrate (S8900), with a cathode film on its backside. An initial light yield of $\\sim$460 VUV photons per drifting electron was measured, which degraded within tens of minutes stabilizing at (27.0~$\\pm$~3.1)~photons per electron. The electroluminescence was accompanied by electron multiplication with an estimated charge gain $<$10. Further investigations are necessary to understand and mitigate the light yield degradation phenomenon. We expect other substrate materials, including VUV-transparent ones, to provide large stable photon yields, compatible with our model predictions. The VCC configuration has demonstrated great potential in single-phase noble-liquid detectors, particularly for dark-matter searches, neutrino physics and other fields.",
