  "title": "Lagrangian Formulation of the Snowplow Model and Operating Point for Z   pinch Devices",
  "abstract": "We write down the lagrangian for the snowplow model of the Z pinch system. Then, we develop the Euler-Lagrange equations to find out the corresponding equations of motion. Next, we set a criterion for quantitatively estimating the performance of Z pinch devices. Finally, we apply this criterion to a specific Z pinch system.",
