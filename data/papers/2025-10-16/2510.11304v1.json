  "title": "In-situ Radiation Damage Study of Silicon Carbide Detectors Subjected to   Clinical Proton Beams",
  "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) planar PiN diodes from two different manufacturers were irradiated with 252.7 MeV protons from a medical synchrotron. Over the course of two 8h irradiation shifts, the samples were exposed to increasing fluences ranging from 1.4e+11 to 3.5e+13 p+/cm^2. Electrical characterizations, including IV and CV measurements, were performed both before and after irradiation using probe stations, and for selected samples even in-situ between fluence steps directly at the irradiation facility. The results show a gradual compensation of the effective epitaxial doping concentration with each incremental fluence step, observed as a reduction in capacitance before full depletion and confirmed by the extracted effective doping concentration. From these measurements, linear donor removal rates are determined for all sample groups, with values ranging from 4.2/cm to 6.4/cm. These findings provide a quantitative basis for understanding radiation-induced charge carrier removal in 4H-SiC devices and are relevant for predicting the performance and lifetime of future radiation-hard detector technologies, including 4H-SiC LGADs.",
