  "title": "Injector for dielectric laser accelerators based on an ultracold   electron source and a magnet design avoiding apparent emittance growth",
  "abstract": "Dielectric Laser Acceleration holds the promise of extremely high acceleration gradients in laser-driven miniaturized accelerator structures. However, sub-relativistic experimental demonstration has so far been limited by bunch charges well below 1 electron per bunch due to the low acceptance of these 'accelerator-on-a-chip' devices. Here, we propose a novel design for an injector tailor made for dielectric laser acceleration, based on just-above-threshold ionization of laser-cooled atoms. The key new feature is a an innovative magnet design that avoids apparent emittance growth by using the field-free regions of an axially polarised ring of permanent magnets as source point. We optimized this design using a multi-objective optimization approach that is also applicable to the development of other sub-relativistic, high-brightness/low-emittance electron beam setups (like setups for ultrafast electron diffraction). The expected injected bunch charge of our proposed injector is 90 (60) electrons for a dielectric laser acceleration gradient of 1 GV/m (100MV/m) operating at a 10 micron driver laser wavelength, increasing the expected bunch charge by about two orders of magnitude.",
