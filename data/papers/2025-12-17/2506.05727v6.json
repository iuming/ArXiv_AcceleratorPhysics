  "title": "Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria",
  "abstract": "The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints. An analytic equilibrium can be found for the case $T = \\frac{T_{p}}{r_{p}^{3}}r^{3}$, and is investigated. The predictions are found to be in good agreement where they should with the observations from the Zap, and Zap-HD DD fusion devices, including a very accurate prediction of the shear, and an axial profile that can be seen developing at multiple instances. The minimum pinch length necessary for this cubic vortex equilibrium to form an SFS state can be arbitrarily small arbitrarily close to the pinch.",
