  "title": "Multichannel SiPM test readout system for gamma-ray measurements with monolithic inorganic CeBr_{3}",
  "abstract": "Energy resolution and the detection efficiency for gamma quanta are fundamental properties in the construction of detectors for ionizing radiation. In this study, a SiPM-based photodetector coupled to a monolithic inorganic CeBr_{3} crystal is exposed to gamma rays in order to study the performance of the CeBr_{3} crystal. Measurements are made using three different radioactive sources - ^{137}Cs, ^{22}Na, and ^{60}Co. For each source, the measurements are conducted at several SiPM bias voltages. Furthermore, two CeBr_{3} crystals with different thicknesses are used in order to study how detector efficiency is affected by crystal dimensions. A preliminary analysis of the data is presented.",
