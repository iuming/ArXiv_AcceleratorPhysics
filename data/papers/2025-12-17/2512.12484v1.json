  "title": "Updated Simulation of GRETA Detector Response and Exploration of Temperature Sensitivity",
  "abstract": "The Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking Array (GRETA) is a next-generation gamma-ray spectrometer designed to push the frontiers of nuclear structure and astrophysics experiment. Its high sensitivity is enabled by high-precision localization of gamma-ray interactions within its active detector volume, and the subsequent tracking of gamma-ray scattering sequences. In order to perform gamma-ray tracking, we need to simulate signal generation in the detectors accurately. This requires both accurate calculations of charge movement in the semiconductor volume, as well as a faithful reproduction of real-world experimental effects such as the electronics response. This work addresses the fidelity of the calculated signals for GRETA in two ways. An updated approach has been applied to find an optimized parameterization of the electronics response, while the impact of the detector temperature was also explored to best reproduce experimental signals and improve the position localization performance for GRETA. The results suggest that the electronics response can be simplified without impacting performance, and that the response correction parameters can effectively compensate for the changes in signal which arise due to the crystal temperature, resulting in minimal sensitivity of the position resolution to the assumed temperature.",
