  "title": "Exploring the performance of SiPM at cryogenic temperature for the sub-meV threshold detector",
  "abstract": "We propose a novel particle detector concept that exploits the breaking of superconducting Cooper pairs, offering a theoretical energy threshold at the sub-meV level. A major challenge for such detectors is the readout of quasiparticles at mK temperatures, where the Cooper pair binding energy is at the sub-meV level, making conventional electronic devices ineffective. Here we demonstrate that silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) retain full avalanche multiplication capability at environmental temperatures as low as 10 mK. Compared to room temperature operation, the dark count rate decreases by seven orders of magnitude while the gain is reduced by only a factor of 4.44. we present a characterization of several important performance parameters of the SiPM at 10~mK, including breakdown voltage, second divergence voltage, operating voltage range, output waveform characteristics, gain, single-photoelectron resolution, dark count rate, and the correlated noise probability. These results show that SiPMs operating at 10 mK provide sufficient gain and extremely low noise suitable for quasiparticle detection. Based on this finding, we propose a conceptual readout scheme for sub-meV threshold superconducting detectors using PN junction electron multiplication, which holds promise for advancing new searches for neutrino, dark matter, and other rare low-energy processes.",
