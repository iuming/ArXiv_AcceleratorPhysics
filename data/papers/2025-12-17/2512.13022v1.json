  "title": "Measurement of Position Resolutions of L-band Cavity Beam Position Monitors",
  "abstract": "Beam position monitors (BPMs) are indispensable components of modern particle accelerators, providing real-time diagnostics to ensure precise beam control, stability, and quality. As accelerators such as the International Linear Collider (ILC) aim for nanometer-scale beam sizes at the interaction point, stringent requirements on position resolution arise. Specifically, the main linac of the ILC demands a BPM resolution better than 5 μm to support stable beam transport and minimize emittance growth. To address this, we have developed an L-band cavity BPM optimized for the beam conditions of the ILC. In this paper, we introduce a prototype of an L-band cavity BPM and its signal processing system, describe the methodology for position resolution measurements, discuss the problems and solutions encountered in the past experiment, and report the projected position resolutions of about 300 nm at best.",
