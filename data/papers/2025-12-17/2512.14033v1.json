  "title": "Liquid Handling of the JUNO Experiment",
  "abstract": "The Filling, Overflow, and Circulation (FOC) system is a critical subsystem of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), responsible for the safe handling of the Liquid Scintillator (LS) and water throughout the detector's commissioning and operational lifetime. This paper details the design and operation of the FOC system, which accomplished the filling of the world's largest LS detector--taking 45 days for water (6.4*10^4 m^3) and 200 days for LS (2.3*10^4 m^3). Throughout water filling, the liquid level difference between the Central Detector and Water Pool was rigorously maintained within safety limits. During LS filling, level control achieved +/-2 cm precision with flow regulation within +/-0.5% of setpoints. An automated control system based on Programmable Logic Controllers and the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System framework ensured reliable operation. The system preserved LS radiopurity, maintaining 222Rn below 1 mBq/m^3 during filling and achieving 238U/232Th concentrations below 10^-16 g/g. The successful commissioning and operation of the FOC system have established it as an indispensable foundation for the stable long-term operation of the JUNO detector.",
