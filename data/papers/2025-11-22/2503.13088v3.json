  "title": "Orbit-Controlled Generation of Two-color Attosecond Mode-locked Free-electron Lasers",
  "abstract": "The generation of attosecond X-ray pulses has garnered significant attention within the X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) community due to their potential for ultrafast time-resolved studies. Such pulses enable the investigation of electron dynamics with unprecedented temporal resolution, opening new avenues in fields such as quantum control and ultrafast spectroscopy. In an FEL, the mode-locking technique synthesizes a comb of longitudinal modes by applying spatiotemporal shifts between the co-propagating radiation and the electron bunch. Here, we propose a novel scheme for generating two-color attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses via orbit control in two-stage mode-locked undulators. Specifically, a chicane with a wiggler inserted in the middle generates periodic temporal-transverse modulation in the electron beam. In this configuration, the low-energy and high-energy components of the beam lase in separate undulator sections, with each producing attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses. Three-dimensional simulations with realistic parameters confirm that trains of 250-attosecond soft X-ray pulses at the gigawatt level can be independently generated in each undulator section. Furthermore, time delay between the two pulse trains can be adjusted over a range of several hundred femtoseconds.",
