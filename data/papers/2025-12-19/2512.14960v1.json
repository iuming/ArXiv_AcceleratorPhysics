  "title": "The PANDA Barrel DIRC: From design to assembly",
  "abstract": "The Barrel DIRC counter will serve as the primary particle identification detector in the PANDA experiment, enabling high-precision hadron physics studies through antiproton-proton annihilations across a momentum range of 1.5 GeV/c to 15 GeV/c. It is designed to distinguish charged pions from kaons with a separation of at least 3 standard deviations up to 3.5 GeV/c within polar angles of 22 degrees to 140 degrees. A lens focusing is used the first time in a DIRC detector. After a successful evaluation in particle beams, the key components, i.e. radiator bars and photon sensors, were purchased and tested.",
