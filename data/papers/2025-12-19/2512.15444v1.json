  "title": "A muon scattering tomography system based on high spatial resolution scintillating detector",
  "abstract": "Cosmic ray muon scattering tomography (MST) is an imaging technique that utilizes muon scattering in matter to inspect high-Z materials non-destructively, without requiring an artificial radiation source. This method offers significant potential for applications in border security and long-term monitoring of nuclear materials. In this study, we developed a high-precision plastic-scintillator-based position-sensitive detector with a spatial resolution of 0.09 times the strip pitch. A fully functional, full-scale imaging system was then constructed using four layers of such XY position-sensitive detectors, each with an effective area of 53 cm x 53 cm. This paper details the following key contributions: the Geant4-simulated design and optimization of the imaging system, the fabrication, assembly, and testing of the detectors, and an evaluation of the imaging performance of the completed system.",
