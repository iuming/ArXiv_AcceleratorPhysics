  "title": "Mechanisms of THz Radiation Generation in Multi-Color Laser-Plasma Interactions: A Review Across Diverse Media",
  "abstract": "The exploration of Terahertz (THz) waves has captivated researchers across diverse scientific disciplines such as physics, spectroscopy, chemistry, biology, and engineering, driven by the myriad applications these waves offer. Within this expansive landscape, the development of efficient and reliable THz sources stands as a paramount objective. In the pursuit of this goal, a multitude of approaches have been undertaken, with a notable contender emerging in the form of laser-induced plasma. Harnessing the advancements in ultrafast pulses, laser-induced plasma has proven to be a promising tool for generating THz waves. Its appeal lies in the robust attributes of a high power threshold, intense THz signal, and an broadband THz spectrum. This paper delves into a comprehensive review of the physics and progress underlying THz generation from laser-induced plasmas, exploring scenarios where plasmas are induced in gases, liquids, and solids. The interactions between lasers and plasmas involve complex physical processes, resulting in a variety of laser plasma scenarios for THz generation. In this review, the focus is specifically placed on classifying THz generation based on different physical mechanisms and also examines the characteristics of the emitted THz waves. By categorizing the processes, a deeper understanding of the underlying principles can be attained.",
