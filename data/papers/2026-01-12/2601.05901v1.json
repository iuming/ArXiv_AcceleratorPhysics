  "title": "Data acquisition from high-rate detectors at MAX IV",
  "abstract": "At MAX IV pixelated area detectors are operated at high frame rates to take advantage of the X-ray beam properties available from the fourth generation synchrotron in scattering, diffraction and imaging applications. A variety of photon counting and charge integrating detectors and sCMOS cameras have been integrated into a common data acquisition (DAQ) system in which data are streamed to a central Kubernetes cluster, mounting an IBM Storage Scale (GPFS) file system. The DAQ system provides live feedback from the detectors/cameras and extends to enable on-the-fly data processing. Control system integration via Tango provides a standardised single interface for controlling all DAQ components. Starting from an overview of the detector types in use, we describe the design and implementation of the MAX~IV detector-DAQ system and report a quantitative study of its performance in terms of data throughput and detector operating rates.",
