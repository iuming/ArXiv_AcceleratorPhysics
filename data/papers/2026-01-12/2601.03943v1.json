  "title": "A laser plasma soliton fusion scheme",
  "abstract": "We introduce a novel fusion scheme enabled by laser-plasma solitons, which promises to overcome several fundamental obstructions to reaching the breakeven condition. For concreteness, we invoke deuterium-tritium (DT) as fuels. The intense electromagnetic field trapped inside the soliton significantly enhances the DT-fusion cross section, its ponderomotive potential evacuates electrons, and it accelerates D/T to kinetic energies suitable for fusion reaction. While electrons are expelled almost instantly, the much heavier D/T moves at picosecond time scale. Such a difference in time scales renders a time window for DT fusion to occur efficiently in an electron-free environment. We inject two consecutive lasers, where the first would excite plasma solitons and the second, much more intense and with a matched lower frequency, would fortify the soliton electromagnetic field resonantly. We impose a plasma density gradient to induce soliton motion. All D/T inside the plasma column swept by the moving soliton during its lifetime would participate in this fusion mechanism. We show that the breakeven condition is attainable. Invoking fiber laser and the iCAN laser technologies for high repetition rate and high intensity operation, gigawatt output maybe conceivable.",
