  "title": "Beam Halo and Bunch Purity Monitoring",
  "abstract": "Beam halo measurements imply measurements of beam profiles with a very high dynamic range, both in transverse and longitudinal planes. This lesson gives an overview of high dynamic range instruments for beam halo measurements. In addition, halo definitions and quantifications in view of beam instrumentation are discussed.",
