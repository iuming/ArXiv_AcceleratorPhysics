    "abstract": "We present the results of a study of lightly doped amorphous silicon used as a resistive medium for high-radiopurity resistors in nuclear and particle physics research instrumentation. Prototypes are produced for a Time Projection Chamber design for the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay search experiment that meet requirements for ultra-high radiopurity, good mechanical, cryogenic and high voltage performance, as well as useful vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) reflectivity. Further study is warranted to refine production methods and to confirm that the technology used here is useful for more general applications.",

    "abstract": "At MAX IV pixelated area detectors are operated at high frame rates to take advantage of the X-ray beam properties available from the fourth generation synchrotron in scattering, diffraction and imaging applications. A variety of photon counting and charge integrating detectors and sCMOS cameras have been integrated into a common data acquisition (DAQ) system in which data are streamed to a central Kubernetes cluster, mounting an IBM Storage Scale (GPFS) file system. The DAQ system provides live feedback from the detectors/cameras and extends to enable on-the-fly data processing. Control system integration via Tango provides a standardised single interface for controlling all DAQ components. Starting from an overview of the detector types in use, we describe the design and implementation of the MAX~IV detector-DAQ system and report a quantitative study of its performance in terms of data throughput and detector operating rates.",

    "title": "Stray Field NMR: a powerful method to measure dynamics at the millisecond scale",
    "abstract": "Transport properties in fluids and confined systems play a central role across a wide range of natural and technological contexts, from geology and environmental sciences to biology, energy storage, and membrane-based separation processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) provides a unique, non-destructive means to probe these properties through species-selective measurements of self-diffusion coefficients. While pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) is routinely used, its access to diffusion times is typically limited to values no shorter than about 10 ms, restricting its applicability to systems with fast dynamics and long relaxation times. Diffusion NMR in a permanent magnetic field gradient (STRAFI) offers a complementary, multiscale approach, enabling diffusion measurements over an extended temporal window, from a few hundred microseconds to several tens of seconds. Despite its strong potential, this technique remains rarely implemented due to experimental and methodological challenges. In this work, we present a robust and versatile STRAFI-based methodology, including a specifically designed experimental setup, optimized pulse sequences, and rigorous data analysis, allowing accurate extraction of self-diffusion coefficients for a broad range of nuclei. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated through diverse applications, including the study of concentrated electrolytes using \"NMR-exotic\" nuclei ($^{35}$Cl, $^{79}$Br/$^{81}$Br, $^{127}$I, $^{17}$O) and the characterization of micrometre-scale porosity in membranes.",

    "title": "Studies of ultrafast dynamics in substrate-free nanoparticles at ELI using Timepix3 optical camera",
    "abstract": "We present a novel application of the Timepix3 optical camera (Tpx3Cam) for investigating ultrafast dynamics in substrate-free nanoparticles at the Extreme Light Infrastructure European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ELI ERIC). The camera, integrated into an ion imaging system based on a micro-channel plate (MCP) and a fast P47 scintillator, enables individual time-stamping of incoming ions with nanosecond timing precision and high spatial resolution. The detector successfully captured laser-induced ion events originating from free nanoparticles disintegrated by intense laser pulses. Owing to the broad size distribution of the nanoparticles (10-500 nm) and the variation in laser intensities within the interaction volume, the detected events range in occupancy from near-zero to extremely high, approaching the readout limits of the detector. By combining time-of-flight and velocity map imaging (VMI) techniques, detailed post-processing and analysis were performed. The results presented here focus on the performance of Tpx3Cam under high-occupancy conditions, which are of particular relevance to this study. These conditions approach the limitations imposed by the camera readout capabilities and challenge the effectiveness of standard post-processing algorithms. We investigated these limitations and associated trade-offs, and we present improved methods and algorithms designed to extract the most informative features from the data.",

The dynamics are governed by classical beam optics parameters (Courant-Snyder parameters), the Twiss functions, and phase advance, revealing a direct map between quantum evolution and its classical counterpart. The solution decomposes into three components, exhibiting a complex rotation dependent on the sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection, alongside an intrinsic distortion from interference governed by a generalized Gouy phase. For a relevant Glaser-type magnetic field and a half-blocked twisted electron, we demonstrate that asymmetry reveals interference-driven dynamics beyond rigid rotation. Our fully relativistic framework provides a practical tool for predicting beam behavior in particle accelerators and electron microscopes.",

This paper introduces a dedicated PI feedback model implemented in the STABLE tracking code to enable accurate and fast longitudinal beam dynamics simulations. The model's key innovation lies in its treatment of the continuous generator current, which is discretized into electron-bunch-like charge pulses, while the cavity voltage is refreshed on an RF-cycle basis. This methodology offers a more physically accurate model of the beam-cavity-feedback coupling, providing a versatile tool for precise longitudinal beam dynamics studies in single- and multi-rf configurations.",

    "title": "Robust Bilinear-Noise-Optimal Control for Gravitational-Wave Detectors: A Mixed LQG/$H_\\infty$ Approach",
    "abstract": "At its lowest frequencies, LIGO is limited by noise in its many degrees of freedom of suspended optics, which, in turn, introduce noise in the interferometer through their feedback control systems. Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design.",

    "title": "Enhanced Dark Matter Sensitivity using a Hybrid SiPM-SNSPD-Qubit Detector in Liquid Argon",
    "abstract": "We investigate novel strategies to extend the sensitivity of dark matter direct detection experiments to energy deposits well below the thresholds of conventional detectors. In liquid-argon time-projection chambers equipped with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), we show that improved optical readout, combined with a nuclear dielectric constant (NDC) correction to the WIMP nucleus interaction, enhances the response to low-momentum-transfer nuclear recoils. The NDC effectively amplifies the interaction strength at small recoil energies, increasing the expected ionization and scintillation yields without modifying the high-energy behavior constrained by calibration data. When coupled to SiPM based light collection, this mechanism lowers the effective detection threshold to the subKeV regime, significantly improving sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs and other weakly interacting particles. Complementarily, we present the design and projected performance of a qubit-based detector optimized for ultra-low-energy depositions. A novel two-chip architecture is employed to minimize signal dissipation, while quantum parity measurements enable enhanced single-phonon sensitivity. Full simulations of phonon propagation and quasiparticle dynamics demonstrate that energy deposits at the level of $\\gtrsim 30 meV$ can be detected with nearly unit efficiency and high energy resolution. This capability is expected to advance sensitivity to dark-matter scattering for masses $m_χ\\gtrsim 0.01 MeV$ by several orders of magnitude for both light and heavy mediators, and to enable competitive searches for axion and dark-photon absorption in the $0.04 - 0.2 eV$ mass range.",

    "abstract": "The inner tracking system of the ATLAS experiment will be upgraded to a full silicon detector in 2030 for HL-LHC. The new tracking system is called ITk, the Inner Tracker. It is required to be operable with efficiency higher than 99\\% and noise hit occupancy smaller than 0.1\\%. During the pre-production phase of the ITk project, many short-strip modules were observed to exhibit so-called \"Cold Noise (CN)\", wherein clusters of strips displayed very high noise when the modules were operated at temperatures below~$-35\\degree$C. To investigate the CN impact and ensure the quality of module production, huge amount of effort have been put in by the collaboration. This paper focuses on the impact of CN on the tracking performance by examining two short strip modules that exhibit CN: one is non-irradiated, while the other one has been irradiated to the maximum expected end-of-lifetime fluence. For each module, the global and single strip tracking performance are evaluated.",

    "title": "Beam-Beam Backgrounds for the Cool Copper Collider",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of beam-beam backgrounds for the Cool Copper Collider (C$^3$), a proposed linear $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider designed for precision Higgs studies at center-of-mass energies of 250 and 550 GeV. Using a simulation pipeline based on the Key4hep framework, we evaluate incoherent pair production and hadron photoproduction backgrounds through the SiD detector for baseline, power-efficiency, and high-luminosity C$^3$ operating scenarios. The occupancy induced by the beam-beam background is evaluated for each scenario, validating the compatibility of the existing SiD detector design with operations at C$^3$ without substantial modifications. At the same time, the modular simulation framework and analysis methodology presented in this paper offer a versatile toolkit for background studies in future collider proposals, contributing to a common platform for different machine designs.",

    "title": "Machine learning for radiative hydrodynamics in astrophysics",
    "abstract": "Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.   Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.   The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.   The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.",

    "title": "A Comprehensive multi-species comparison of rotational temperature probes in a DC Ar/N$_2$ micro-hollow cathode discharge",
    "abstract": "Accurate gas temperature ($T_{\\rm Gas}$) determination in microplasmas is critical for optimizing their applications, yet isolated diagnostic approaches may yield misleading results, especially under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Here, high resolution rotational spectra of N$_2$(C), OH(A), NH(A) and NO(A), generated in the plasma jet of a DC Ar/N$_2$ microhollow cathode discharge (MHCD), are recorded and their associated rotational temperatures ($T_{\\rm rot}$) are cross compared. A detailed experimental analysis and robust fitting of the rotational spectra are performed, achieving a reliable estimation of $T_{\\rm Gas}$. The dominant formation mechanisms of these species and their corresponding impact on rotational population distributions are also interrogated. Particularly, our findings indicate that the $T_{\\rm rot}$of N$_2$(C) is significantly influenced by energy transfers from argon metastables (Ar$^m$) and spectral interference from NH(A). This makes it unreliable as a thermometric probe in Ar-rich MHCD, unless complex analyses are employed. In contrast, OH(A) rotational population distribution appears to be less sensitive to Ar-induced perturbations across various discharge currents and pressures, providing more straightforward results. For all molecules considered, this study reveals the conditions under which all the measured $T_{\\rm rot}$ can be reliably considered to be in equilibrium with $T_{\\rm Gas}$. This highlights the importance of crossvalidating multiple thermometric probes and investigating relevant excitation kinetics when measuring $T_{\\rm rot}$ in reactive microplasmas.",

    "title": "Wakefield Acceleration in a Layered Plasma Waveguide",
    "abstract": "Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches. The 2.5D particle-in-cell code was used to simulate the witness acceleration of an electron bunch by a wakefield created by drive electron bunches in a two-layer plasma wakefield accelerator. The simulation showed good agreement with the results of analytical calculations.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel, versatile traction force microscopy framework for quantifying three-dimensional (3D) interfacial forces during bio-adhesion by integrating in situ stereo digital image correlation with finite element (FE) simulation. The method enables accurate measurement of microscale displacements and force distributions at the interfaces in both dry and wet environments, addressing limitations of conventional microscopy techniques related to limited measurement scales, restricted fields of view, and surface disturbance from contact or fluorescence. An analytical model was developed to guide the design of a deformable substrate, supporting selection of substrate material and thickness of the substrate. System accuracy was examined through steel ball compression experiments, which were validated against FE simulations. The framework was applied to marine mussel plaque adhesion under 15 directional tension to characterize interfacial traction force distributions. Sensitivity analyses examined the effects of Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and constitutive models on the results. This approach offers a versatile platform for investigating interfacial mechanics in adhesives, with broad relevance to bioengineering applications.",

    "abstract": "The NEXT collaboration is investigating the double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe using high-pressure gas electroluminescent time projection chambers, which provide excellent energy resolution together with a robust topological signature. Operating at the Laboratorio Subterráneo de Canfranc (LSC) and building on the success of the NEXT-White detector, the NEXT-100 apparatus began commissioning in May 2024 and started operation with xenon at a pressure of 4 bar in October 2024.   We report here the first results obtained with NEXT-100 using low-energy calibration data from $^{83m}$Kr decays, which allow mapping of the detector response in the active volume and monitoring of its stability over time. After homogenizing the light response, we achieve an energy resolution of 4.37% FWHM at 41.5 keV for $^{83m}$Kr point-like energy deposits contained in a radius of 425 mm. In a fiducial region representing the operating conditions of NEXT-100 at 10 bar we obtain an improved energy resolution of 4.16% FWHM. These results are in good agreement with that obtained in NEXT-White, and an $E^{-1/2}$ extrapolation to $Q_{ββ}$ yields an energy resolution close to 0.5% FWHM, well below the 1% FWHM design target.",

    "title": "Spatial resolution(s) in atom probe tomography",
    "abstract": "Atom probe tomography (APT) is often quoted to provide \"atomic-scale\" analysis of materials in three dimensions. Despite efforts to quantify APT's spatial resolution, misunderstanding remain regarding its true spatial performance. If the depth resolution was once reported to be 20 pm, quoting this value outside of its specific context is misleading and should be avoided. The resolution achievable in pure metals, at one specific location within one reconstructed dataset, does not generally apply across materials or analysis conditions, or even throughout a single tomographic reconstruction. Here, we review various efforts at defining and measuring the spatial resolution in the study of single phase and single element materials - i.e. pure metals - in field-ion microscopy (FIM) and APT. We also report on the degradation of the resolution arising from ion optical devices used to improve the mass-resolution. We aim to offer some perspective as to how reported resolutions may be or may not be of any relevance to most of the materials characterisation efforts by APT, including cases of precipitates in a matrix that emphasise the need to consider an effective resolution. Finally, we discuss concepts to improve the spatial accuracy of the technique in a relatively distant future.",

    "title": "Optimization of laser-driven proton acceleration in a near-critical-density plasma",
    "abstract": "Optimizing laser and plasma parameters is crucial for enhancing accelerated proton energy in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. Tight focusing plays a significant role in improving laser-driven proton acceleration, which is generally believed as a result of the enhancement of laser intensity. However, we find that even at a fixed laser intensity, reducing the focal spot size still enhances the proton energy. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at a small spot size (0.8 μm), the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 56.3% compared to that obtained at a conventional spot size (3 μm). This improvement is attributed to the dominance of ponderomotive-force-driven electrons at reduced spot sizes, which generate stronger charge-separation fields that propagate at higher velocities. Furthermore, to optimize proton acceleration, we analytically derive an ideal plasma density profile that promotes phase-stable proton acceleration, yielding an additional energy increase of 61.3% over the case of a tightly focused laser interacting with a planar target of uniform density. These findings remain robust under parameter variations, indicating that advanced focusing techniques combined with optimized plasma profiles could relax the demand for high laser energies, thereby reducing the reliance on large-scale laser facilities in medical and scientific applications.",

    "title": "Detection of MEMS Acoustics via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy",
    "abstract": "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have traditionally addressed vastly different length scales - one resolving atoms, the other engineering macroscopic motion. Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions. This technique provides a general platform for minimally-perturbative detection across a wide range of nanomechanical and quantum devices.",

    "title": "Ultra-sensitive graphene-based electro-optic sensors for optically-multiplexed neural recording",
    "abstract": "Large-scale neural recording with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for understanding information processing in brain, yet current neural interfaces fall far short of comprehensively capturing brain activity due to extremely high neuronal density and limited scalability. Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $μ$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent timing resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine learning has been integrated into the detector design process from the ground up. Detector design objectives are defined using Machine Learning based reconstruction and Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design. The highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for much more expensive detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system and a neutron hadron calorimeter. In EIC kinematics, charged particles are best measured through tracking rather than calorimetry, but the hKLM can identify and measure the momentum of neutral hadrons. The latter are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\\% are achieved using time of flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than that demonstrated for similar calorimeters read out with less granularity.",

    "title": "Properties of Magnetic Switchbacks in the Near-Sun Solar Wind",
    "abstract": "Magnetic switchbacks are fluctuations in the solar wind in which the interplanetary magnetic field sharply deflects away from its background direction so as to create folds in magnetic field lines while remaining of roughly constant magnitude. The magnetic field and velocity fluctuations are extremely well correlated in a way corresponding to Alfvénic fluctuations propagating away from the Sun. For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation. We identify and collate several open questions and recommendations for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the increased interest in pulsed-power magneto-inertial fusion devices in recent years, we present a method for implementing an arbitrarily shaped embedded boundary on a Cartesian mesh while solving the equations of compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics. The method is built around a finite volume formulation of the equations in which a Riemann solver is used to compute fluxes on the faces between grid cells, and a face-centered constrained transport formulation of the induction equation. The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. We present a thorough verification of the method and show that it converges at second order in the absence of discontinuities, and at first order with a discontinuity in material properties.",

One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.",

Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $β= 2μ_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$β$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $β$.

    "abstract": "The $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reaction plays a crucial role in stellar evolution, including the occurrence of supernova explosions, and in the synthesis of the chemical elements. However, our understanding of its cross section remains severely deficient, particularly below $E_\\textrm{cm}=2.5$\\,MeV, the energy range of interest for astrophysics. To address these unresolved issues, the LUNA collaboration will conduct a dedicated study of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction at the Bellotti Ion Beam Facility (Bellotti IBF) located deep underground within the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. Based on the combination of passive and active shields, this campaign aims to achieve unprecedented sensitivity in measuring the cross sections of the two key reaction channels, $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$α$)$^{20}$Ne and $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$p$)$^{23}$Na in the low-energy regime via $γ$-ray detection. Here, we report on a sensitivity study for the upcoming campaign with a focus on the characterization of two detectors, namely a HPGe detector and a NaI(Tl) array. Furthermore, their intrinsic contamination is thoroughly investigated since this could potentially influence the overall sensitivity. Assuming typical beam intensities of the Bellotti IBF, we will be able to investigate reaction rates significantly below 100 counts per day. In case of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction we therefore expect to acquire experimental data well below the current limit of $E_\\textrm{cm}=2.1\\,$MeV. The results are supported by simulations to highlight the advantageous low-background environment, essential for high-precision nuclear astrophysics studies.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionise the future of scientific simulations. To harness the capabilities that QC offers, we can integrate it into hybrid quantum-classical simulations, which can boost the capabilities of supercomputing by leveraging quantum modules that offer speedups over classical counterparts. One example is quantum Monte Carlo integration, which is theorised to achieve a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo, making it suitable for high-energy physics, strong-field QED, and multiple scientific and industrial applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo can be used to predict the number of pairs created when two photon beams collide head-on, a problem relevant to high-energy physics and intense laser-matter interactions. The results from the quantum simulations demonstrate high accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. The accuracy of the simulations is only constrained by the approximations required to embed polynomials and to initialise the quantum state. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be used in current quantum hardware, providing up to 90 % accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we propose pathways towards integrations with classical simulation codes.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel fusion scheme enabled by laser-plasma solitons, which promises to overcome several fundamental obstructions to reaching the breakeven condition. For concreteness, we invoke deuterium-tritium (DT) as fuels. The intense electromagnetic field trapped inside the soliton significantly enhances the DT-fusion cross section, its ponderomotive potential evacuates electrons, and it accelerates D/T to kinetic energies suitable for fusion reaction. While electrons are expelled almost instantly, the much heavier D/T moves at picosecond time scale. Such a difference in time scales renders a time window for DT fusion to occur efficiently in an electron-free environment. We inject two consecutive lasers, where the first would excite plasma solitons and the second, much more intense and with a matched lower frequency, would fortify the soliton electromagnetic field resonantly. We impose a plasma density gradient to induce soliton motion. All D/T inside the plasma column swept by the moving soliton during its lifetime would participate in this fusion mechanism. We show that the breakeven condition is attainable. Invoking fiber laser and the iCAN laser technologies for high repetition rate and high intensity operation, gigawatt output maybe conceivable.",

    "title": "Programmable Focal Elongation and Shaping of High-Intensity Laser Pulses using Adaptive Optics",
    "abstract": "Controlling the intensity distribution of laser pulses in the focal region is essential for optimizing optically generated plasma waveguides and enabling advanced plasma acceleration techniques, including dephasingless wakefield acceleration. Here, we present a method for programmatic structuring of the high-intensity focal region of a standard off-axis parabolic mirror, extending the length of this region well beyond the Rayleigh length and enabling control over the longitudinal intensity distribution. The theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations and experimental measurements. Further, we demonstrate the use of this technique in an existing plasma accelerator system using readily available hardware components. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this method to multi-GeV laser plasma acceleration and the generation of flying foci, research areas which would significantly benefit from improved programmatic structuring of high-intensity laser pulses.",

    "title": "Mechanisms of THz Radiation Generation in Multi-Color Laser-Plasma Interactions: A Review Across Diverse Media",
    "abstract": "The exploration of Terahertz (THz) waves has captivated researchers across diverse scientific disciplines such as physics, spectroscopy, chemistry, biology, and engineering, driven by the myriad applications these waves offer. Within this expansive landscape, the development of efficient and reliable THz sources stands as a paramount objective. In the pursuit of this goal, a multitude of approaches have been undertaken, with a notable contender emerging in the form of laser-induced plasma. Harnessing the advancements in ultrafast pulses, laser-induced plasma has proven to be a promising tool for generating THz waves. Its appeal lies in the robust attributes of a high power threshold, intense THz signal, and an broadband THz spectrum. This paper delves into a comprehensive review of the physics and progress underlying THz generation from laser-induced plasmas, exploring scenarios where plasmas are induced in gases, liquids, and solids. The interactions between lasers and plasmas involve complex physical processes, resulting in a variety of laser plasma scenarios for THz generation. In this review, the focus is specifically placed on classifying THz generation based on different physical mechanisms and also examines the characteristics of the emitted THz waves. By categorizing the processes, a deeper understanding of the underlying principles can be attained.",

    "title": "Modelling spacecraft-emitted electrons measured by SWA-EAS experiment on board Solar Orbiter mission",
    "abstract": "Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.",

    "title": "First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal for low energy dark matter search",
    "abstract": "The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80 K. This work reports the first experimental characterization of an approximately 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The net photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is approximately 4.5 photoelectrons/keV after crosstalk correction, which is rather promising in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.",

    "title": "On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer",
    "abstract": "Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, frequency-domain in-situ high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in diamond anvil cells (DACs) has been employed as a structural and electronic probe of condensed matter systems at pressures well into the megabar range. However, extensive spin interactions and sample heterogeneities under pressure often lead to significant spectral overlap, inhibiting independent observation of chemically similar spin sub-species in the same sample. In this work, we introduce a time-domain relaxometry framework specifically suited for DAC experiments, named muT2-NMR. Experimental flexibility and operational robustness are benchmarked on three hydrogen-rich molecular solids at pressures up to 72 GPa. We demonstrate that muT2-NMR can resolve individual molecular subunits in relaxation space, paving the way for novel high-pressure, high-resolution NMR applications in molecular solids.",

    "title": "Data-driven methods to discover stable linear models of the helicity injectors on HIT-SIU",
    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient circuit models are necessary to control the power electronic circuits found on plasma physics experiments. Tuning and controlling the behavior of these circuits is inextricably linked to plasma performance. Linear models are greatly preferred for control applications due to their well-established performance guarantees, but they typically fail to capture nonlinear dynamics and changes in experimental parameters. Data-driven system identification can help mitigate these shortcomings by learning interpretable and accurate reduced-order models of a complex system, in this case the injector circuits of the Helicity Injected Torus - Steady Inductive Upgrade (HIT-SIU) experiment. Specifically, the Bagging Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition (BOP-DMD), is leveraged to learn stable, reduced order models of the interaction between the spheromak plasma formed in the confinement volume, and the injector circuits of the device. BOP-DMD is trained and evaluated on an analytic model of the vacuum dynamics of the injector circuits of HIT-SIU, as well as an analytic linear reduced-order model for the injector dynamics when a plasma is present. BOP-DMD is then fit on experimental data, both on shots with and without a plasma in the confinement volume. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of data-driven methods to produce stable, linear models for control and uncertainty quantification in plasma experiments.",

    "title": "Measurements of enriched 155 Gd and 157Gd converters with the NMX detector on the nTOF EAR2 beam line at CERN",
    "abstract": "The detectors for the NMX instrument at the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund use natural Gd as the neutron converter. In 2024, beam time was obtained at the neutron time-of flight experiment (nTOF) at CERN to study the feasibility of an upgrade to enriched Gd. A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX detector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were attached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets of measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the 157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the subsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region between 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The peaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in the ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of counts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at the center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched 157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to natural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 % increase in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %) and previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background detection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this deviation. An upgrade of the natural Gd converter to enriched 157Gd would thus lead to an efficiency increase of at least 60 %. The measurements presented in this paper are the first successful time-of-flight measurements with the NMX detector prototype and the ESS VMM readout.",

    "title": "Exploring the fusion power plant design space: comparative analysis of positive and negative triangularity tokamaks through optimization",
    "abstract": "The optimal configuration choice between positive triangularity (PT) and negative triangularity (NT) tokamaks for fusion power plants hinges on navigating different operational constraints rather than achieving specific plasma performance metrics. This study presents a systematic comparison using constrained multi-objective optimization with the integrated FUsion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) framework. Over 200,000 integrated design evaluations were performed exploring the trade-offs between capital cost minimization and operational reliability (maximizing $q_{95}$) while satisfying engineering constraints including 250 $\\pm$ 50 MW net electric power, tritium breeding ratio $>$1.1, power exhaust limits and an hour flattop time. Both configurations achieve similar cost-performance Pareto fronts through contrasting design philosophies. PT, while demonstrating resilience to pedestal degradation (compensating for up to 40% reduction), are constrained to larger machines ($R_0$ $>$ 6.5 m) by the narrow operational window between L-H threshold requirements and the research-established power exhaust limit ($P_{sol}/R$ $<$ 15 MW/m). This forces optimization through comparatively reduced magnetic field ($\\sim$8T). NT configurations exploit their freedom from these constraints to access compact, high-field designs ($R_0 \\sim 5.5$ m, $B_0$ $>$ 12 T), creating natural synergy with advancing HTS technology. Sensitivity analyses reveal that PT's economic viability depends critically on uncertainties in L-H threshold scaling and power handling limits. Notably, a 50% variation in either could eliminate viable designs or enable access to the compact design space. These results suggest configuration selection should be risk-informed: PT offers the lowest-cost path when operational constraints can be confidently predicted, while NT is robust to large variations in constraints and physics uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Detection and characterization of small-scale energetic events such as nanoflares and nanojets remain challenging owing to their short lifetimes, small spatial extent, and relatively low energy release, despite their potential role in coronal heating. Recent observations have identified nanojets as small-scale (length $\\lesssim 6.6$~Mm, width $\\lesssim 1$~Mm), fast ($\\sim$~few 100 km s$^{-1}$), and short-lived ($\\lesssim 30$~s) ejections associated with nanoflare-scale energies, providing evidence of magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales. However, the lack of synthetic diagnostics has limited the connection between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and observations. In this Letter, we present synthetic observations of the coalescence of two flux ropes, leading to nanojet-like signatures from a numerical model obtained with the \\texttt{MPI-AMRVAC} code. We report synthetic observables in Extreme-ultraviolet lines compatible with existing instruments such as SDO/AIA, and upcoming MUSE mission, and compare the synthetic observables with an existing observation of nanojets. The synthetic diagnostics of the emissivity maps, Doppler velocity, thermal, and non-thermal line broadening produce key observational properties, suggesting a plausible 3D scenario for nanojet generation where tiny flux ropes reconnect within loops. Our results provide predictions for the detectability of nanojets with current and future spectroscopic facilities, and establish a bridge between MHD modeling and observations.",

    "abstract": "The origin of non-thermal power-law distribution functions ubiquitously observed in astrophysical/space (e.g., the solar wind) and laboratory kinetic plasmas, is not well understood. Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $κ= 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $κ\\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $κ\\to 1.5$ limit.",

CP significantly accelerated germination time, reducing median germination time by 8 hours compared to the control, and enhanced photo synthetic pigments, leading to higher biomass (25.87 mg/sprout fresh weight and 1.45 mg/sprout dry weight). UV treatments, particularly UV-C, increased chlorophyll and total flavonoid content. Overall, CP effectively promotes alfalfa germination and growth, while UV treatments improve specific phytochemicals.",

    "title": "First comments on a descoped/staged FCC-ee",
    "abstract": "In response to its remit, the European Strategy Group (ESG) recommended the electron-positron Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) as the preferred option for the next flagship collider at CERN; and a descoped FCC-ee as the preferred alternative option (with reduced synchrotron radiation (SR) power, without a run at the $\\rm t \\bar t$ threshold, and with only two interaction regions) in the event that the preferred option turns out not to be feasible. Upon request of the ESG, a basic comparison of the physics potential of the descoped option with that of the baseline version is presented in this short note. Our first observations about the alternative proposal of a descoped FCC-ee are that (i) the same performance as the baseline, apart from $\\rm t \\bar t$-run related, is achieved with the longer proposed period of operation; and (ii) the top run remains essential, but can be staged at a later date. The full appraisal of the consequences of descoping and a proposal for the best way to integrate possible staging wherever feasible, and possible improvements, will need further joint studies by the physics and accelerator groups.",

    "title": "Spaceflight KID Readout Electronics for PRIMA",
    "abstract": "We present the design and testing of a prototype multiplexing kinetic inductance detector (KID) readout electronics for the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) space mission. PRIMA is a Probe-class astrophysics mission concept that will answer fundamental questions about the formation of planetary systems, the co-evolution of stars and supermassive black holes in galaxies, and the rise of heavy elements and dust over cosmic time. The readout electronics for PRIMA must be compatible with operation at Earth-Sun L2 and capable of multiplexing more than 1000 detectors over 2.5 GHz bandwidth while consuming around 30 W per readout chain. The electronics must also be capable of switching between the two instruments, which have different readout bands: the hyperspectral imager (PRIMAger, 2.6-4.9 GHz) and the spectrometer (FIRESS, 0.4-2.4 GHz). The PRIMA readout electronics use high-heritage SpaceCube digital electronics with a build-to-print SpaceCube Mini v3.0 board using a radiation-tolerant Kintex KU060 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a custom high-speed digitizer board, along with RF electronics that provide filtering and power conditioning. We present the driving requirements for the system, as well as the hardware, firmware, software, and system-level design that meets those requirements.",
