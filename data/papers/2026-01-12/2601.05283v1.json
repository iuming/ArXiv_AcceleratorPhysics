  "title": "First comments on a descoped/staged FCC-ee",
  "abstract": "In response to its remit, the European Strategy Group (ESG) recommended the electron-positron Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) as the preferred option for the next flagship collider at CERN; and a descoped FCC-ee as the preferred alternative option (with reduced synchrotron radiation (SR) power, without a run at the $\\rm t \\bar t$ threshold, and with only two interaction regions) in the event that the preferred option turns out not to be feasible. Upon request of the ESG, a basic comparison of the physics potential of the descoped option with that of the baseline version is presented in this short note. Our first observations about the alternative proposal of a descoped FCC-ee are that (i) the same performance as the baseline, apart from $\\rm t \\bar t$-run related, is achieved with the longer proposed period of operation; and (ii) the top run remains essential, but can be staged at a later date. The full appraisal of the consequences of descoping and a proposal for the best way to integrate possible staging wherever feasible, and possible improvements, will need further joint studies by the physics and accelerator groups.",
