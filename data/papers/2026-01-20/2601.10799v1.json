  "title": "The BigBite Calorimeter for the Super Bigbite Spectrometer Program at Jefferson Lab",
  "abstract": "We report features of the design, construction, installation, and performance of the BigBite Calorimeter (BBCal), a lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter constructed as part of the BigBite Spectrometer (BBS), which served as the electron arm for the Super Bigbite Spectrometer (SBS) program of high-precision neutron electromagnetic form factor measurements in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. As a total-absorption calorimeter, BBCal provided the primary electron trigger for BBS, detecting (quasi-) elastically scattered electrons in the 1-4 GeV energy range with an energy resolution of approximately 6.2%, position resolution of 1.2 cm, and timing resolution of 0.5 ns.",
