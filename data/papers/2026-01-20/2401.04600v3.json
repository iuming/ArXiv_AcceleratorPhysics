  "title": "Theoretical research on low-frequency drift Alfvén waves in general Tokamak equilibria",
  "abstract": "We developed kinetic models based on general fishbone-like dispersion relations. Firstly, a general model for arbitrary magnetic configuration and ion orbit width is presented. Then, by disregarding ion orbit width and approximating the magnetic geometry as circular, we introduce a simplified model that fully incorporates circulating/trapped ion effects. Finally, by considering the limit of ions being well-circulating or deeply trapped, the results directly revert to those observed in earlier theoretical studies.",
