  "title": "Generation and Enhancement of Persistent Nanoscale Magnetization in All-Dielectric Metasurfaces by Optically Injected and Localized Free Carriers",
  "abstract": "Time-varying dielectric metasurfaces supporting sharp optical resonances with a non-trivial electromagnetic field distribution represent a unique platform for realizing temporal interfaces for metasurface-guided waves (MGWs). Rapidly changing metasurface resonance enables frequency conversion and temporal scattering of a concurrently propagating MGW. Using analytical methods and electromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that localized free-carrier generation can be engineered to produce frequency-shifted, time-refracted, and reflected infrared MGWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such time interfaces can be utilized to generate large, highly localized quasistatic magnetic fields within the metasurfaces. The resulting nanoscale magnetization, supported by the residual circulating currents, persists after the departure of the time-scattered MGWs. We further demonstrate that the initial electromagnetic energy of the injected MGWs is partitioned between the time-reflected/refracted MGWs, residual motion of the free carriers, and a quasistatic magnetic field.",
