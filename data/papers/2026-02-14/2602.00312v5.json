  "title": "Self ordering to imposed ordering of dust -- a continuous spatial phase transition experiment in MDPX",
  "abstract": "Previous experiments conducted in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX) revealed an intriguing phenomenon first referred to as imposed ordering. This occurs when micron-sized dust particles become aligned with the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above the dust (at a distance much larger than the plasma Debye length or the ion-neutral or electron-neutral mean free paths) in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the mesh. In this work, results of a transition experiment are presented wherein starting from a classical two-dimensional Coulomb crystal with hexagonal symmetry in an unmagnetized plasma $(B = 0\\,T)$, dust transitions to a state in which it flows along the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above it, mapping out the 4-fold symmetry of the boundary condition. It is hypothesized that beyond a certain magnetization, elongated electric potential structures emanating from the mesh drive the dust motion to reflect the mesh morphology, transitioning from a 6-fold self ordering to 4-fold imposed ordering. The various dust phases are quantified and a critical value of magnetic field is identified in the transition experiment indicating the onset of imposed ordering.",
