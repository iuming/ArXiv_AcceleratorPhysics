    "title": "TCAD Parameters for 4H-SiC: A Review",
    "abstract": "In this literature review we investigate the permittivity, density-of-state mass, band gap, impact ionization, charge carrier recombination, incomplete ionization and mobility in 4H silicon carbide. We provide a comprehensive overview over characterization methods, models and parameters to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and allow a critical evaluation of common material property descriptions. We further highlight areas for future research by identifying gaps in the current knowledge base.   For each investigated property we found a large amount of models and parameter sets based on measurements, calculations or fittings. With literal and/or graphical comparisons we reveal qualitative good agreement but also flawed data values, misinterpretations of research results and inconsistencies among multiple investigations, even those directly referencing each other. We identify parameter variations, e.g., due to temperature, with high impact that are rarely considered in 4H-SiC analyses and common values that are based on old research of deviating materials or properties. We further show the slow accommodation of recent research results within the scientific community and reveal missing characterization data but also insufficient models in state-of-the-art technology computer aided design (TCAD) tools. Overall, our review enables scientifically based decisions on 4H-SiC material parameters and unravels the demand for further investigations to validate commonly used values, confirm hypothesis and cover additional dependencies.",

    "title": "Data-Driven Calibration of Large Liquid Detectors with Unsupervised Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a novel method to extract photomultiplier tube (PMT) calibration timing constants in large liquid scintillation detectors from physics data using the machinery of unsupervised deep learning. The approach uses a simplified physical model of optical photon transport in the loss function, with PMT calibration constants treated as free parameters, and the simple assumption that individual events represent point-like emission. The problem is, thus, effectively reduced to that of regression on a very large scale, made tractable by deep learning architectures and automatic differentiation frameworks. Using data from the 9,300 PMTs in the SNO+ detector, the method has been shown to reliably extract 3 calibration constants for each of the over 7,500 online PMTs using radioactive background events. We believe that this basic approach can be straightforwardly generalised for a wide range of applications.",

    "title": "First results of a Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor with Internal Signal Gain Fully Integrated in a 180 nm CMOS Technology",
    "abstract": "Dense tracking environments in experiments at CERN's High-Luminosity LHC and future FCC experiments call for an increased use of timing information in addition to the position measurement of pixel detectors. This adds one dimension to the information available, and is essential for pile-up mitigation at high luminosity. The CASSIA sensor project (CMOS Active SenSor with Internal Amplification) focuses on the development of pixel matrices with internal charge multiplication based on monolithic CMOS sensor technologies suitable for application as charged particle tracking and timing detectors. CMOS sensors with in-pixel internal amplification would result in higher signal amplitudes having an improved signal-to-noise ratio, better time resolution and increased sensitivity, making them attractive for high-radiation environments. Their monolithic integration in small pixels reduces the input capacitance of a front-end amplifier and power dissipation making it suitable for fine-pitch low-power detectors. Fast signal rise time due to internal charge amplification improves the response time and timing resolution, all of which makes such a technology attractive for future 4D tracking applications in HEP experiments. This paper presents the first results of the CASSIA sensor, a novel MAPS which uses gain layers fully integrated in a 180nm imaging process to achieve internal signal amplification. In the first measurements presented here we demonstrate the gain behaviour of different pixel implant designs and show that the sensor can be operated with low gain proportional mode as LGAD sensor at lower voltages and as SPAD sensor at higher voltages.",

    "title": "Design optimization of silicon nitride nanomechanical resonators for thermal infrared detectors: a guide through key figures of merit",
    "abstract": "Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling. Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use cases.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks with sub-microsecond inference latency are required by many critical applications. Targeting such applications deployed on FPGAs, we present High Granularity Quantization (HGQ), a quantization-aware training framework that optimizes parameter bit-widths through gradient descent. Unlike conventional methods, HGQ determines the optimal bit-width for each parameter independently, making it suitable for hardware platforms supporting heterogeneous arbitrary precision arithmetic. In our experiments, HGQ shows superior performance compared to existing network compression methods, achieving orders of magnitude reduction in resource consumption and latency while maintaining the accuracy on several benchmark tasks. These improvements enable the deployment of complex models previously infeasible due to resource or latency constraints. HGQ is open-source and is used for developing next-generation trigger systems at the CERN ATLAS and CMS experiments for particle physics, enabling the use of advanced machine learning models for real-time data selection with sub-microsecond latency.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the characterisation and testing of the first wafer-scale monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS) prototype developed for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade that is to be installed during the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2030). The MOSS chip design is driven by the truly cylindrical detector geometry that imposes that each layer is built out of two wafer-sized, bent silicon chips. The stitching technique is employed to fabricate sensors with dimensions of 1.4 $\\times$ 25.9 cm, thinned to 50 $μ$m. The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements. The MOSS chip demonstrates the feasibility of the ITS3 detector concept and provides insights for further optimisation and development.",

    "abstract": "In non-degenerate integrable Hamiltonian systems, invariant tori can be parameterized equivalently by action variables or by their fundamental frequencies. We introduce an invariant-flow formulation for extracting fundamental frequencies of integrable Hamiltonian systems. By treating invariants as generators of commuting Hamiltonian flows, the frequencies are obtained from time-of-flight parameters along these flows, providing a direct alternative to action-angle constructions and spectral methods based on long time series. The approach yields an explicit numerical procedure that extends naturally to systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using the McMillan map, where machine-precision accuracy is achieved.",

    "title": "A nanopore-gated sub-attoliter silicon nanocavity for single-molecule trapping and analysis",
    "abstract": "Biomolecules exhibit dynamic conformations critical to their functions, yet observing these processes at the single-molecule level under native conditions remains a formidable challenge. While surface immobilization has been widely used to extend observation times, it could disrupt molecular dynamics and impede biological function. Moreover, the study of weak molecular interactions requires high local concentrations, often leading to problems with signal saturation in fluorescence-based approaches. Recent advancements in single-molecule trapping techniques have addressed some limitations, but achieving precise, controllable, long-term trapping in a molecularly crowded environment without external forces remains difficult. Here, we introduce a nanopore-gated sub-attoliter silicon nanocavity that enables precise, non-perturbative trapping of individual biomolecules for extended observation times, eliminating the need for external forces. Using nucleosomes as model systems, we demonstrate single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor relative distances. Our data also show that an applied electric field can modulate the conformational properties of macromolecules, emphasizing a key advantage of our device: it does not require an electric field to retain trapped molecules. We envision this nanocavity platform as a powerful tool for interrogating molecular dynamics in physiologically relevant environments, offering unperturbed access to weak and transient interactions that are central to biological regulation.",

    "title": "Fully stabilized 25 GHz frequency comb for frequency calibration of optical spectrum analyzer",
    "abstract": "Optical spectrometers are widely used in scientific and industrial applications, and precise frequency calibration is essential for ensuring their reliable performance. Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range. This approach improves both the calibration and performance evaluation of spectrometers, and it contributes to the advancement of optical metrology.",

    "abstract": "Halbach spheres provide a theoretically elegant means of generating highly homogeneous magnetic fields, but practical implementation is hindered by challenging fabrication and restricted interior access. This study examines discrete spherical Halbach configurations assembled from permanent magnets placed at the vertices of Platonic and Archimedean solids. Analytical calculations, numerical field simulations, and experimental measurements indicate that polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry achieve the most favorable balance among field strength, homogeneity, and interior accessibility. They produce exceptionally flat fourth-order central saddle points, resulting in a usable homogeneous field volume up to a factor of 260 larger than that of traditional Halbach disk or cylindrical arrays. Several magnet assemblies composed of cubical NdFeB magnets are fabricated and their three dimensional field distributions characterized, demonstrating homogeneous regions of up to several cubic centimeters with deviations below 1%. The findings establish discrete icosahedrally symmetric magnet arrays as practical, scalable building blocks for compact, highly homogeneous magnetic field sources suited to mobile magnetic resonance, and magnetophoretic applications.",

A limiting factor for high-resolution STXM imaging is given by the positioning precision of the sample with respect to the focusing optic, with the current state-of-the-art leading to significant overheads, especially at low pixel dwell times, and being vulnerable to unavoidable external vibrations sources. In this work, we present a method, called supersampled scanning microscopy, that allows for a significant reduction of overhead times while simultaneously removing the effects of vibrational noise by sampling the position of the sample at a rate significantly higher than the vibration spectrum and reconstructing the sample transmission image from the recorded list of positions and detector counts. We demonstrate the performance of the technique with a set of proof-of-concept high-resolution imaging experiments.",

    "title": "Quantitative phase nano-imaging with a laboratory source",
    "abstract": "Investigating the structure of matter at the nanoscale non destructively is a key capability enabled by X-ray imaging. One of the most powerful nano-imaging methods is X-ray ptychography, a coherent diffraction imaging technique that has become the go-to method at synchrotron facilities for applications ranging from brain imaging to battery materials. However, the requirements in terms of X-ray beam quality have limited its use to large synchrotron facilities and, to date, only one attempt has been made to translate the technique to a small-scale laboratory. To unleash the power of this technique to the broad user community of laboratory X-ray sources, there are outstanding questions to answer including whether the quantitativeness of the information is preserved in a laboratory despite the drastic decrease in X-ray flux of several orders of magnitude, with respect to synchrotron instruments. In this study not only we demonstrate that the quantitativeness of X-ray ptychography is preserved in a laboratory setting, but we also apply the method to the imaging of a brain tissue phantom. Finally, we describe the current challenges and limitations, and we set the basis for further development and future directions of quantitative nano-imaging with laboratory X-ray sources.",

    "abstract": "We present the architecture, design and first test results of SPIDER, the first prototype of a TSMC CMOS 65 nm ASIC designed for the time measurement path of LHCb Electromagnetic Calorimeter after LS4 Upgrade.   The main requirements for the readout of this detector are a time resolution below 15 ps rms above 5 GeV, and a channel occupancy up to 30\\% (12 Mevent/s).   The first prototype called SPIDER\\_V0 is a 2-channel waveform digitizer locked on the LHC clock allowing precise time reconstruction by digital algorithms. The architecture is based on 2 DLLs in series controlling respectively the phase of the sampling window and the sampling frequency, the latter covering the range between 2 and 20 GS/s. Each self-triggering channel houses 8 banks of 32 analog memory cells and a massively parallel Wilkinson ADC for conversion at 5 GHz over 10 bits with a maximal conversion time of 200 ns.   SPIDER targets not only LHCb, but all fast detectors mounted on current and future accelerators. Its sampling frequency can indeed be adjusted to different signal risetimes. Its main frequency of 40 MHz could even be eventually locked to another value by modifying only one of the DLLs in the chip design.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the effect of spectral pulse shaping of the laser driver on the performance of channel-guided, laser-plasma accelerators. The study was carried out with the assistance of Bayesian optimization using particle-in-cell simulations. We used a realistic plasma profile based on a novel optical-field-ionized channel technique with ionization injection and low on-axis plasma densities to maximize the energy gain of the electron bunch trailing the laser. Spectral shaping allows us to modify the temporal profile of the laser driver while keeping the laser energy constant, affecting the acceleration and injection processes. Given the complexity and breadth of the parameter space in question, we used numerical optimization to identify high performers. In particular, we found laser profiles with additional spectral content that, when used with optimal plasma channel parameters, result in charge content an order of magnitude higher than the baseline Gaussian case while also increasing the mean energy of the electron bunch.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and manipulating two-dimensional materials for real-world applications remains challenging due to a lack of effective and high-throughput characterization techniques. Soft X-ray time-of-flight photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) provides element- and depth-sensitive information of materials and buried interfaces. However, chromatic and spherical aberrations cannot be corrected with electron-lens combinations. These aberrations, combined with astigmatism and space-charge effects, significantly degrade the spatial and energy resolutions. To overcome this limitation, we outline a spatial-attention based deep learning approach to automatically correct for these effects and attain nanometer resolution over the entire field-of-view (FoV). The combination of this corrective algorithm with XPEEM, termed as nanoXPEEM, establishes a new record of 48-nm spatial resolution with a 232-micrometer diameter FoV in the soft x-ray regime (700-1000 eV). nanoXPEEM provides unique spatial mapping of the element-specificity, depth-sensitivity, and local structure on the nanoscale. It can bridge the current gap to achieve angstrom (atomic) scale resolution.",

    "abstract": "We present a non-invasive spectroscopic technique to measure electric fields in plasma, leveraging large polarizabilities and Stark shifts of Rydberg atoms. Rydberg Stark shifts are measured with high precision using narrow-linewidth lasers via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of rubidium vapor seeded into a continuous, inductively coupled radio-frequency (rf) plasma in a few mTorr of argon gas. Without plasma, the Rydberg-EIT spectra exhibit rf modulation sidebands caused by electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions in the rf drive coil. With the plasma present, the rf modulation sidebands vanish due to screening of the rf drive field from the plasma interior. The lineshapes of the EIT spectra in the plasma reflect the plasma's Holtsmark microfield distribution, allowing us to determine plasma density and collisional line broadening over a range of pressures and rf drive powers. The work is expected to have applications in non-invasive spatio-temporal electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure plasma, plasma sheaths, process plasma and dusty plasma.",

The high detector sensitivity allows collection of rich diffraction information - providing dislocation defect contrast that is otherwise not accessible via EBSD.

    "abstract": "Designed to provide quality assurance for ion-beam radiotherapy, the prototype fIVI (filtered Interaction Vertex Imaging) Range Monitoring System is a two-layer tracker which employs double-sided strip-segmented silicon detectors. To meet the high demands of a clinical environment, a large sensitive area is required, along with a fast and compact readout. As this device utilizes sensors and readout electronics adapted from particle physics, where the expected energy and count rate differ significantly from radiotherapy, validation was necessary to ensure that these sensors would function effectively at the order 100 MeV/u energies and order MHz count rates expected during clinical irradiation. Tests were conducted using scattered subclinical 19 MeV protons at high intensity, and clinical 207 MeV/u carbon ions at low intensity to independently validate these variables. The detection system is found to operate at rates up to 1.3 MHz, with a negligible fraction of events being affected by pileup. The efficiency of hit reconstruction is high, with a timestamp resolution of 6.25 ns, and a coincidence window of 31.25 ns, as is required for clinical event rates. With these settings, over 90% of particle interactions are able to reconstruct unique hit positions and contribute to track formation. This device is the first system using large-area, high-resolution detectors which meets the demanding count rate requirements associated with clinical radiotherapy.",

This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, and also in pixel count and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and timewalk effect, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy.

    "title": "Quantifying Resolution Limits in Pedestal Profile Measurements with Gaussian Process Regression",
    "abstract": "Edge transport barriers (ETBs) in magnetically confined fusion plasmas, commonly known as pedestals, play a crucial role in achieving high confinement plasmas. However, their defining characteristic, a steep rise in plasma pressure over short length scales, makes them challenging to diagnose experimentally. In this work, we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to develop first-principles metrics for quantifying the spatiotemporal resolution limits of inferring differentiable profiles of temperature, pressure, or other quantities from experimental measurements. Although we focus on pedestals, the methods are fully general and can be applied to any setting involving the inference of profiles from discrete measurements. First, we establish a correspondence between GPR and low-pass filtering, giving an explicit expression for the effective `cutoff frequency' associated with smoothing incurred by GPR. Second, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, \\(N_{eff}\\), which measures the effective number of data points contributing to the inferred value of a profile or its derivative. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the trade-off between `over-fitting' and `over-regularization', providing both practitioners and consumers of GPR with a systematic way to evaluate the credibility of inferred profiles. We apply these tools to develop practical advice for using GPR in both time-independent and time-dependent settings, and demonstrate their usage on inferring pedestal profiles using measurements from the DIII-D tokamak.",

    "title": "CARONTE: a Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine-Based Algorithm for Plasma Boundary Reconstruction in Magnetically Confined Fusion Devices",
    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel physics informed neural network based algorithm for real time plasma boundary reconstruction in tokamak devices. The approach is based on a single Extreme Learning Machine network used to solve the homogeneous Grad Shafranov equation, which is required to identify the plasma boundary. This architecture enables the real time training of the network parameters using the available magnetic sensor data and, consequently, dynamically adapting the network output to the evolving plasma equilibrium. We demonstrate that, the network performs accurate plasma boundary reconstruction for complex configurations, outperforming well established methods, such as the algorithm used for decades at the Joint European Torus, the world's largest tokamak, until it ceased operation in 2023. Indeed, compared to the latter, the proposed solution better generalizes the poloidal flux function, without requiring algorithm retuning across different plasma equilibria. The proposed neural network reconstructor demonstrates also greater robustness with respect to noise on the magnetic measurements. Moreover, this method takes advantage of the generalization power of neural networks but without the need for extensive, time consuming training based on a huge amount of experimental data, making its implementation on existing devices straightforward.",

    "abstract": "To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The high-radiation regions of the the CE, where fluences between $1\\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses of up to 2\\,MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of $3\\,ab^{-1}$, will be equipped with silicon pad sensors. This includes the entire electromagnetic as well as parts of the hadronic section of the CE. The silicon sensors are processed on 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300\\,\\textmu m, 200\\,\\textmu m and 120\\,\\textmu m and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the full wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor, several small test structures (e.g. pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at JSI (Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) to fluences between $5\\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1.5\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. This study focuses on the isothermal annealing behavior of the bulk material at different temperatures between 5.5°C and 60°C using electrical characterization and charge collection measurements. The results are used to extract the annealing time constants for this material and fluence range based on the Hamburg model approach to allow an estimation of the expected annealing effects in silicon sensors during the year-end technical stops and the long HL-LHC shutdowns. The annealing parameters found will make it possible to model the annealing behavior of p-type silicon detector projects at HL-LHC fluence ranges better than the existing Hamburg model.",

    "title": "Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma",
    "abstract": "Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.",

These setups will enable precision measurements of the weak mixing angle at low energies and allow accurate extraction of the neutron nuclear distribution radius. We also demonstrate that next-generation detectors will place constraints on the neutrino charge radius comparable to or better than current global fits. In addition, we explore the sensitivity to non standard neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as magnetic moments and millicharges, as well as new mediators.

    "title": "Disruption Modelling for Engineering and Physics Design of Tokamak Energy ST-E1 Fusion Power Plant",
    "abstract": "Plasma disruptions represent a critical challenge for high-performance tokamak operations, as they can compromise machine integrity and reduce operational availability. Although future fusion devices essentially need to incorporate strategies to minimise disruption occurrence, complete avoidance remains unattainable. Consequently, assessing and characterising unmitigated disruption consequences is fundamental for the design and qualification of next-generation fusion power plants. This work supports the pre-conceptual design of ST-E1, a low aspect-ratio Tokamak Fusion Power Plant developed by Tokamak Energy Ltd., by presenting a comprehensive disruption modelling approach applied across different design stages. The methodology integrates both physics and engineering considerations to evaluate the impact of disruptions on machine performance and structural integrity. From an engineering perspective, several ST-E1 layout options were analysed to investigate the electromagnetic response of key components under disruption-induced loads, enabling comparison between alternative design solutions. On the physics side, a broad set of disruption scenarios was explored, scanning operational space parameters, plasma-material interactions, and associated thermal loads. Furthermore, the study examined variations in disruption behaviour arising from different reference equilibria, focusing on a range starting from Double Null to Single Null configurations, reflecting the increasing up-down asymmetry consequences. The results reveal significant contrasts in plasma dynamics and structures electromagnetic behaviour between configurations, highlighting the importance of disruption modelling in guiding design choices. These analyses have proven instrumental in shaping ST-E1 development, offering critical insights for mitigating risks and optimising future fusion reactor designs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and preliminary performance evaluation of a new heavy ion detector for direct measurements of heavy Λ hypernuclei lifetime. The detector employs the previously developed 10 picosecond resolution Radio Frequency (RF) Timer, which converts the temporal information of incident particles into spatial coordinates of secondary or photoelectrons on a position-sensitive detector by means of circular RF scanning in the 500-1000 MHz range. Here, we report the detector design to achieve efficient suppression of accidental background and effective separation of prompt reaction products and delayed events from Λ hypernuclei decays, results of test studies carried out with RF synchronized laser as well as preliminary results obtained by using alpha particles. Dedicated Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed to estimate the detector's performance under realistic experimental conditions at RF-driven electron, photon, or proton beams. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed design and provide a basis for upcoming experimental measurements, based on the delayed fission detection.",

    "title": "SCOPE: Simple Coil Optimization for Plasma and Engineering",
    "abstract": "Designing superconducting coils for a tokamak fusion device is a highly coupled, non-linear design problem. The coils have many disparate engineering requirements from structural to power electronics, as well strict limits placed on the system by the high temperature superconducting (HTS) cables. Simultaneously, the coils must be able to contain multiple plasma scenarios from inception, through ramp up, to flat top, and ramp down, all whilst applying a large, controlled, inductive voltage to drive current. In addition, we wish to optimize divertor separatrices to increase the likelihood of designing a suitable divertor strikepoint. Lastly, the physical limits of the entire tokamak must be taken into account and space reserved for support structures, access for maintenance schemes, and installation limits. The method outlined here uses a combined simulated annealing method to find optimal coil sizes and positions with a constrained quadratic or quartic optimization for the coil currents. The method is designed to optimize coils for multiple scenarios simultaneously, including ramp-ups, to avoid over optimization of a single design point. A key enabler is the efficient implementation that allows millions of evaluations to be performed in a few hours with modest computational power. This optimization method is part of a larger, iterative workflow which enables further, detailed design work to feedback on the optimization.",

Validated on experimental data from the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and Hefei Light Source, the model achieves high prediction accuracy with a sub-millisecond latency of 0.042 ms per bunch. This performance demonstrates its potential as a core tool for real-time, multi-parameter diagnostics and active feedback in next-generation light sources.",

    "title": "Conceptual study on using Doppler backscattering to measure magnetic pitch angle in tokamak plasmas",
    "abstract": "We introduce a new approach to measure the magnetic pitch angle profile in tokamak plasmas with Doppler backscattering (DBS), a technique traditionally used for measuring flows and density fluctuations. The DBS signal is maximised when its probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, independent of the density fluctuations. Hence, if one could isolate this effect, DBS would then yield information about the magnetic pitch angle. By varying the toroidal launch angle, the DBS beam reaches cutoff with different angles with respect to the magnetic field, but with other properties remaining similar. Hence, the toroidal launch angle which gives maximum backscattered power is thus that which is matched to the pitch angle at the cutoff location, enabling inference of the magnetic pitch angle. We performed systematic scans of the DBS toroidal launch angle for repeated DIII-D tokamak discharges. Experimental DBS data from this scan were analysed and combined with Gaussian beam-tracing simulations using the Scotty code. The pitch-angle inferred from DBS is consistent with that from magnetics-only and motional-Stark-effect-constrained (MSE) equilibrium reconstruction in the edge. In the core, the pitch angles from DBS and magnetics-only reconstructions differ by one to two degrees, while simultaneous MSE measurements were not available. The uncertainty in these measurements was under a degree; we show that this uncertainty is primarily due to the error in toroidal steering, the number of toroidally separated measurements, and shot-to-shot repeatability. We find that the error of pitch-angle measurements can be reduced by optimising the poloidal launch angle and initial beam properties.",

    "abstract": "In plasma X ray photoelectron spectroscopy emerges as a powerful platform for real time, in situ chemical analysis under conditions relevant to semiconductor processing and other plasma enabled technologies. This study investigates the origins of binding energy shifts and satellite peaks formation observed during plasma XPS measurements across conductive, dielectric, and gas phase systems. Using a standard laboratory based ambient pressure XPS apparatus coupled with an alternating current driven capacitively coupled plasma source, we show that metastable surface species, such as transient Au oxides, can be detected during plasma exposure, revealing chemical states hardly accessible using conventional ultrahigh vacuum XPS. In dielectric samples, we observe pressure- and plasma type dependent BE shifts up to 50 eV, attributed to X ray induced and plasma mediated surface charging. These shifts are mitigated at higher pressures plasmas or in electronegative plasmas, the latter due to enhanced charge compensation mechanisms involving slow negative ions. For gas phase species, AC plasma excitation leads to spectral broadening and the emergence of satellite peaks with a few eV energy separations, linked to oscillating local plasma potentials in the probing volume. These findings highlight the important and complex interplay of plasma parameters, surface charging, and local electric fields in shaping XPS spectra. Overall, plasma XPS emerges as a critical metrological tool for probing transient surface chemistry, with implications for semiconductor processing, material synthesis, and plasma diagnostics.",

    "title": "Direct calculation of steady-state hydrodynamic solar wind solutions with newtonian viscosity",
    "abstract": "Steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are known to admit solutions that are singular at the sonic point. Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.",

    "title": "The impact of plasma turbulence on atomic reaction rates in detached divertors",
    "abstract": "Numerical modeling of the edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) must account for atomic processes such as hydrogenic ionization and recombination, charge-exchange, and line radiation. Their reaction rates depend non-linearly on density and temperature and are thus sensitive to turbulent fluctuations, whose inclusion/omission may significantly affect model outcomes. We quantify the impact of fluctuations by studying global turbulence simulations of the edge and SOL of ASDEX-Upgrade in both attached and detached conditions. While the effect of fluctuations is minimal for the attached state, pronounced discrepancies emerge in colder, detached conditions. When accounting for turbulent fluctuations, ionization and radiation rates at the detachment front are reduced by a factor of 2 when compared to mean-field calculations. The effect arises from fluctuations crossing below the ionization temperature threshold, facilitated by low mean temperature and increased fluctuation amplitudes at the detachment front. The rate reduction (rather than rate increase) is explained by the character of divertor fluctuations (negative density-temperature correlation, i.e. cold and dense blobs), notably distinct from characteristic fluctuations found at the outboard-midplane (positive correlation, i.e. hot and dense blobs). Furthermore, the cold and dense fluctuations enable efficient plasma recombination even at average temperatures above the recombination threshold. In detached conditions, the combined plasma particle source from ionization and recombination is therefore effectively reduced by at least 50% when compared to the standard mean-field source.",

    "title": "Tensor network approaches for plasma dynamics",
    "abstract": "The dynamics of plasmas are governed by a set of non-linear differential equations which remain challenging to solve directly for large 2D and 3D problems. Here we investigate how tensor networks could be applied to plasmas described by the Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations and investigate parameter regimes which show promise for efficient simulations. We show for low-dimensional problems that the simplest form of tensor networks known as a Matrix Product State performs sufficiently well, however in regimes with a strong permanent magnetic field or high-dimensional problems one may need to consider alternative tensor network geometries. We conclude the study of the Vlasov-Maxwell system with the application of tensor networks to an industrially relevant test case and validate our results against state of the art plasma solvers based on Particle-In-Cell codes. We also extend the application of tensor networks to the alternative plasma description of Magnetohydrodynamics and outline how this can be encoded using Matrix Product States.",

    "title": "Self-confinement of relativistic pair beams in magnetized interstellar plasmas: the case of pulsar X-ray filaments",
    "abstract": "The observation of filamentary X-ray structures near bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) -- such as the Guitar, Lighthouse, and PSR J2030$+$4415 nebulae -- and of slow-diffusion regions around pulsars like Geminga, Monogem, and PSR J0622$+$3749, challenges the standard picture of cosmic-ray transport in the interstellar medium, implying a diffusion coefficient two orders of magnitude smaller than the Galactic average. The suppressed diffusion can be attributed to self-generated magnetic turbulence, driven -- via the non-resonant streaming instability -- by electron--positron pairs escaping the PWNe. This instability requires a net current, yet the beam of escaping pairs is expected to be charge-neutral. We show that a charge-neutral pair beam propagating through an electron--proton plasma can spontaneously generate a net current. Using fully kinetic two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic mass ratio, we find that beam electrons get focused into self-generated magnetic filaments produced by the nonlinear evolution of the Weibel instability, while beam positrons remain unconfined. The resulting net (positron) current drives the non-resonant streaming instability, further amplifying the magnetic field. This mechanism provides a pathway for the onset of charge asymmetries in initially charge-neutral pair beams and for the growth of magnetic fluctuations that efficiently scatter the beam particles, with implications for the formation of X-ray filaments and, more broadly, for particle self-confinement in TeV halos around PWNe.",

    "title": "Exploring the Physics of the Plasma Liner Experiment: A Multi-dimensional Study with FLASH, OSIRIS, and HELIOS",
    "abstract": "The Plasma Liner Experiment (PLX) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is a platform that seeks to achieve fusion via the Plasma-Jet-Driven Magneto-Inertial Fusion (PJMIF) concept. The experiment utilizes a constellation of plasma guns to generate fusion-relevant conditions and consists of three main phases: (1) target formation, in which up to four plasma guns shoot magnetized hydrogen or deuterium-tritium jets to form a quasi-spherical target, (2) liner formation, in which a 36 guns fire high-atomic-number (e.g., xenon) jets to form a liner shell, and (3) target compression, in which the formed liner implodes the pre-formed target. Each phase of the PLX operates in different plasma regimes, with different physics at play, thus each phase must be simulated separately with appropriate codes. In this study we highlight 1-, 2-, and 3-D simulation results of all three phases using the FLASH, OSIRIS, and HELIOS codes. Some of the key physical processes involved include shock dynamics, kinetic effects, anisotropic thermal conduction, resistive magnetic diffusion, radiation transport, and magnetized jet dynamics. The simulations show that the PLX can form a preheated ($\\sim$40 eV), magnetized (electron Hall parameter $>$1) target plasma, and a quasi-collisional liner shell, which can subsequently compress the target to fusion-relevant conditions, reaching temperatures in excess of 1 keV.",

    "title": "Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection",
    "abstract": "Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.",

    "title": "Probing the Firn Refractive Index Profile Using Antenna Response",
    "abstract": "The Radio Neutrino Observatory-Greenland (RNO-G, at Summit Station) experiment comprises an extensive fat-dipole antenna array deployed into ice boreholes over an eventual area of approximately 35 ${\\rm km}^2$. Since the RNO-G experimental sensitivity depends on the radio-frequency properties of the firn, which are known to vary laterally on sub-km distance scales and vertically on sub-meter distance scales, a technique for quickly extracting information on firn ice properties with depth ($n(z)$) during drilling and deployment is desirable. Given that a dipole's resonant wavelength is fixed by geometry, the resonant frequency $f_{res}$ (measured as an S-parameter reflection coefficient [`$S_{11}$'] minimum) scales inversely with the local refractive index, allowing a translation of a depth-dependent $S_{11}$(z) profile into $n(z)$. $S_{11}$(z) data were initially taken in August, 2024 using a dipole lowered into a newly-drilled $98\\pm 1$-mm diameter, 350-m deep borehole at Summit Station, Greenland, approximately 1 km from the site of the original GISP-2 core; improved measurements were subsequently made in May, 2025.

    "abstract": "The effect of magnetic islands on plasma flow and turbulence has been experimentally investigated in the stellarator W7-X. Magnetic configurations with the 5/5 magnetic island positioned at the plasma edge, inside the last closed flux surface, are studied. The main diagnostic used in the present work is a V-band Doppler reflectometer that allows the measurement of the perpendicular plasma flow and density fluctuations with good spatial resolution. A characteristic signature of the 5/5 magnetic island is clearly detected in the perpendicular flow profile. The comparison of the experimental flow and the neoclassically driven $E\\times B$ flow indicates that the island contribution to the flow is maximum at the island boundaries and close to zero at the island O-point. Besides, a reduction in the density fluctuation level is found nearby the island O-point. The similarities between these observations and those found in other devices and in gyrokinetic simulations are discussed.",

In this study, we propose a plastic scintillator detector which demonstrates the ability to clearly distinguish fast neutrons, thermal neutrons, and gamma rays within mixed radiation fields, offering a practical approach for multi-radiation detection. Two plastic scintillator assemblies: EJ200+EJ426 and EJ276+EJ426 were setup, and the system energy response was calibrated using three gamma sources(137Cs, 22Na and 60Co). An Am-Be neutron source was employed, and pulse shape discrimination(PSD) was used to separate fast neutrons, thermal neutrons and gamma rays. Using a three-sigma discrimination criterion, the EJ200+EJ426 configuration was found to reliably distinguish thermal neutrons from gamma rays, while the EJ276+EJ426 configuration can effectively discriminate fast neutrons, thermal neutrons and gamma rays at gamma-equivalent energies above 1 MeV.",

    "title": "Radial electric field and density fluctuations measured by Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase in W7-X",
    "abstract": "Radial profiles of density fluctuations and radial electric field, $E_r$, have been measured using Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase achieved, under different heating power levels and magnetic configurations, along the 2018 W7-X experimental campaign. A pronounced $E_r$-well is measured with local values as high as -40 kV/m in the radial range $ρ\\sim 0.7-0.8$ during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase. The maximum $E_r$ intensity scales with both plasma density and Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) power level following a similar trend as the plasma energy content. A good agreement is found when the experimental $E_r$ profiles are compared to simulations carried out using the neoclassical codes DKES and KNOSOS. The density fluctuation level decreases from the plasma edge toward the plasma core and the drop is more pronounced in the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase than in reference gas fuelled plasmas. Besides, in the post-pellet phase, the density fluctuation level is lower in the high iota magnetic configuration than in the standard one. In order to discriminate whether this difference is related to the differences in the plasma profiles or in the stability properties of the two configurations, gyrokinetic simulations have been carried out using the codes \\texttt{stella} and EUTERPE. The simulation results point to the plasma profile evolution after the pellet injection and the stabilization effect of the radial electric field profile as the dominant players in the stabilization of the plasma turbulence.",

    "abstract": "We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the inferred beam energy.",

Independent verification requires NaI(Tl)-based detectors with enhanced low-energy sensitivity. Current detectors rely on photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which features limited detection efficiency, intrinsic radioactivity, and high noise at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project that developed a proof of concept NaI(Tl) detector where siliconphotomultipliers (SiPMs) have been used instead of PMTs, offering higher photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most of all, a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the dark noise. The setup includes a custom cryostat operating at approximately 80 K. We report the first characterization of an approximately 360 g NaI(Tl) crystal coupled to a 5 x 5 cm SiPM matrix, yielding 4.5 photoelectrons\\keV after crosstalk correction. This promising result demonstrates the feasibility of SiPM-based readout for NaI(Tl) and paves the way for future large-scale dark matter experiments.",

    "abstract": "The development of nuclear fusion requires materials that can withstand extreme conditions. The IFMIF-DONES facility, a high-power particle accelerator, is being designed to qualify these materials. A critical testbed for its development is the MuVacAS prototype, which replicates the final segment of the accelerator beamline. Precise regulation of argon gas pressure within its ultra-high vacuum chamber is vital for this task. This work presents a fully data-driven approach for autonomous pressure control. A Deep Learning Surrogate Model, trained on real operational data, emulates the dynamics of the argon injection system. This high-fidelity digital twin then serves as a fast-simulation environment to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. The results demonstrate that the agent successfully learns a control policy that maintains gas pressure within strict operational limits despite dynamic disturbances. This approach marks a significant step toward the intelligent, autonomous control systems required for the demanding next-generation particle accelerator facilities.",

    "title": "The role of the exchange-Coulomb potential in two-dimensional electron transport",
    "abstract": "We develop a quantum kinetic theory of two-dimensional electron gases in which exchange is treated self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level and enters as a nonlocal, momentum-dependent field in phase space. By starting from the Coulomb Hamiltonian, we derive a Hartree-Fock-Wigner equation for the electronic Wigner function and obtain a closed fluid model with exchange-corrected pressure, force, and current. For a single layer, we show that exchange renormalizes the Fermi velocity and can drive a long-wavelength plasmonic instability at low densities. In coupled layers, the same framework predicts acoustic-optical mode coupling, and an instability forming long-lived charge-imbalance patterns that are not predicted by classical Vlasov and Boltzmann models. Finally, we apply the kinetic model to the Coulomb drag problem and show how exchange substantially enhances the drag resistivity in dilute GaAs double wells, quantitatively matching experimental observations.",
