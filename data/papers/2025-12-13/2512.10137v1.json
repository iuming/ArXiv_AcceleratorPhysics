  "title": "μRWELL-PICOSEC: Precision Timing with Resistive Micro-Well Detector",
  "abstract": "The PICOSEC detector concept uses a micro-pattern gaseous detector (MPGD) amplification structure combined with a Cerenkov radiator coated with a semi-transparent photocathode to provide below tens of picosecond-level precision timing capabilities with minimum ionizing particles. PICOSEC has triggered interest in the development of time-of-flight detectors for particle identification and timing detectors for track reconstruction in the high rate environment of future nuclear and high energy physics experiments. The PICOSEC Micromegas (or PICOSEC-MM) detector, developed by the CERN-based PICOSEC collaboration, use the Micromegas structure for gaseous amplification and achieve below 20 ps timing resolution. A new type of PICOSEC detector, the μRWELL-PICOSEC based on μRWELL amplification structure, is being investigated at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) alongside PICOSEC-MM R&D efforts in Europe. Preliminary results from the two 2024 beam test campaigns at CERN demonstrate a timing performance better than 24 ps is achievable with a single-channel μRWELL-PICOSEC prototype. A vigorous R&D effort is ongoing to improve the timing performance, robustness and operational stability of μRWELL-PICOSEC detectors. Development of a large size μRWELL-PICOSEC is also under consideration for applications in large scale experiments.",
