  "title": "Demonstration and frequency noise characterization of a 17 $μ$m quantum cascade laser",
  "abstract": "We evaluate the spectral performance of a novel continuous-wave room-temperature distributed feedback quantum cascade laser operating at the long wavelength of 17 $μ$m. By demonstrating broadband laser absorption spectroscopy of the $ν$2 fundamental vibrational mode of N2O molecules, we have determined the spectral range and established the spectroscopic potential of this laser. We have characterized the frequency noise and measured the line width of this new device, uncovering a discrepancy with the current consensus on the theoretical modeling of quantum cascade lasers. Our results confirm the potential of such novel narrow-line-width sources for vibrational spectroscopy. Extending laser spectroscopy to longer wavelength is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for a wide range of opportunities from chemical detection, to frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interaction with an extended variety of molecules, from ultra-cold diatomic species to increasingly complex molecular systems.",
