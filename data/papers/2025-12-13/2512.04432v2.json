  "title": "Design and Performance Simulation of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter at EicC",
  "abstract": "The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a key detector component for precise electron and photon measurements in electron-ion collision experiments. At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector.",
