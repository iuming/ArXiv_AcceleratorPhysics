    "title": "New Challenges in Plasma Accelerators: Final Focusing for Wakefield Colliders",
    "abstract": "The focusing of particle beams for collider experiments is crucial for maximizing the luminosity and thus the discovery potential of these machines. In recent years, plasma wakefield acceleration has emerged as a leading candidate for achieving higher energy collisions with smaller facility footprints due to the large accelerating gradients in the plasma. This higher beam energy poses significant challenges for the final focusing system of the collider. Here, we discuss the various challenges of final focusing for TeV-scale plasma accelerators and propose possible solutions. Finally, we present the first design of a final focusing system for a 10 TeV linear wakefield collider, evaluate its performance, and discuss its shortcomings as well as improvements for future designs.",

    "title": "Proton Computed Tomography Image Reconstruction Based on the Richardson-Lucy Algorithm",
    "abstract": "Proton therapy is an emerging method in cancer therapy. One of the main developments is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position calculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP) measurements. A promising choice is the application of proton computed tomography (pCT) systems which takes the images under similar conditions, as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging and treatment. A key aim is to develop a precise image reconstruction algorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance.   In this work, an iterative image reconstruction algorithm, based on the Richardson-Lucy iteration is proposed for the first time for proton CT image reconstruction. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of CTP528 and CTP404 phantoms were used to benchmark the proposed method. In the case of an idealized detector setup, using a 1 mm pitch grid, 4.88 lp/cm spatial resolution and 0.66% average RSP uncertainty was achieved. The present method provides a promising proof-of-concept candidate for compromise between accuracy and speed with several further development directions.",

    "title": "Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED",
    "abstract": "QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\\textemdash Schrödinger versus Heisenberg\\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.",

    "title": "A journey to ITACA: Ion Tracking with Ammonium Cations Apparatus",
    "abstract": "A unique feature of gas xenon electroluminescent time projection chambers (GXeEL TPCs) in $0νββ$ searches is their ability to reconstruct event topology, in particular to distinguish \"single-electron\" from \"double-electron\" tracks, the latter being the signature of a $0νββ$ decay near the decay endpoint $Q_{ββ}$. Together with excellent energy resolution and the t$_0$ provided by primary scintillation, this topological information is key to suppressing backgrounds. Preserving EL, however, requires operation in pure xenon (with helium as the only benign additive), where electron diffusion is large. Consequently, reconstructed track fidelity is limited by diffusion and intrinsic EL blurring. We propose augmenting the detector with the ability to image not only the electron track but also the corresponding mirror ion track. Introducing trace amounts of NH$_3$ ($\\sim$100 ppb) converts primary xenon ions into ammonium ions, NH$_4^+$, via a fast two-step ion-molecule process involving charge transfer followed by proton transfer, while leaving EL unaffected. Electrons drift rapidly to the anode, producing the standard EL image, whereas NH$_4^+$ ions drift slowly toward the cathode, allowing time to determine the event energy and barycenter. For events in the region of interest, an ion sensor near the cathode at the projected barycenter captures the ions. Laser interrogation of the sensor's molecular layer then reveals an ion-track image with sub-millimeter diffusion and no EL-induced smearing. Combined electron-ion imaging strengthens topological discrimination, improving background rejection by about an order of magnitude and significantly extending the discovery potential of GXeEL TPCs for very long $0νββ$ lifetimes.",

    "title": "The COHERENT Experiment: 2026 Update",
    "abstract": "The COHERENT experiment measures neutrino-induced recoils from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) with multiple nuclear targets at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA. Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\\sim$50 MeV. Many of these cross sections have never been measured before, but are critical input for the interpretation of core-collapse supernova detection in large-scale neutrino experiments such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and HALO.",

    "title": "The Numerics of VMEC++",
    "abstract": "VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/PARVMEC) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.",

    "title": "From Coils to Surface Recession: Fully Coupled Simulation of Ablation in ICP Wind Tunnels",
    "abstract": "This work presents a fully coupled, multiphysics computational framework for predicting the thermo-chemical material response of thermal protection systems in inductively coupled plasma (ICP) wind tunnels. The framework integrates a high-fidelity Navier-Stokes plasma solver, an electromagnetic field solver, and a discontinuous-Galerkin material response solver using a partitioned coupling strategy. This enables an ab initio, end-to-end simulation of the 350 kW Plasmatron X facility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), including plasma generation, electromagnetic heating, near-wall thermochemistry, and time-accurate material ablation. The model captures key ICP physics such as vortex-mode recirculation, Joule-heating-driven plasma formation, and Lorentz-force-induced flow confinement, and accurately predicts the transition from subsonic to supersonic jet behavior at low pressures. Validation against cold-wall calorimetry and graphite ablation experiments shows that predicted stagnation-point heat fluxes fall well within experimental uncertainty, while fully coupled simulations accurately reproduce measured stagnation temperature histories and recession rates with errors below 12% and 10%, respectively. Remaining discrepancies during early transient heating are attributed to uncertainties in power-coupling efficiency, equilibrium ablation modeling, and material property datasets. Overall, the framework demonstrates strong predictive capability for ICP wind tunnel environments and provides a foundation for improved design, interpretation, and planning of hypersonic material testing campaigns.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a detailed investigation of solid-fluid phase coexistence in a bilayer dusty plasma crystal subjected to varying confinement ring bias voltages in a DC glow discharge argon plasma. Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and the associated increase in non-reciprocal interaction strength are strongly correlated with the onset of structural destabilization. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging that integrates down-sampling with super-resolution image reconstruction via a compressive sensing framework. A custom condenser aperture with six randomly positioned circular holes is employed to produce a multi-beam STEM probe, with the beam shape and distribution tuned through defocus. While the raw multi-beam images exhibit overlapping patterns, reconstruction using Adam optimization and total variation normalization yields high-fidelity images that closely reproduce the original sample structures, even from substantially down-sampled data. The proposed approach offers a pathway toward significant acceleration of such techniques through multibeam sparse sampling and computational reconstruction potentially useful for the analytical scanning methods in general.",

    "title": "The First Instrumentally Documented Fall of an Iron Meteorite: atmospheric trajectory and ground impact",
    "abstract": "Iron meteorite falls are rare compared to stony meteorites, and until recently no iron meteorite had a reliably determined pre-atmospheric orbit. This changed on 2020 November 7, when a bright fireball was observed across Sweden and neighboring regions, with optical, acoustic, and seismic detections extending up to 665 km from the trajectory. After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near Ådalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball. We combine optical, infrasound, and seismic data to reconstruct the luminous trajectory and employ a Monte Carlo model to simulate the dark flight phase and predicted strewn field, while also investigating the plausibility of a ricochet prior to final deposition. Our analysis identifies distinct aerodynamic properties of iron meteoroids compared to stony bodies, including the influence of streamlined shapes and deep regmaglypts on drag and flight stability, underscoring the need to incorporate iron-specific parameters into entry models to constrain atmospheric dynamics and improve recovery predictions for future events.",

    "title": "Flux pumping and bifurcated relaxations of helical core in 3D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of ASDEX Upgrade plasmas",
    "abstract": "Flux pumping was achieved in recent hybrid scenario experiments in the ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) tokamak, which is characterized by a sawtooth-free helical quiescent state and the anomalous radial redistribution of toroidal current density and poloidal magnetic flux. In this article, the self-regulation mechanism of the AUG core plasma during flux pumping is investigated at realistic parameters using the JOREK code based on the two-temperature, nonlinear, full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. A key milestone in AUG flux pumping modelling is achieved by quantitatively reproducing the clamped current density and safety factor profiles in the plasma core, demonstrating the effectiveness of the dynamo effect in sustaining the flux pumping state. The dynamo term, that is of particular interest, is primarily generated by the pressure-gradient driven m/n = 1/1 quasi-interchange-like MHD instability. The work systematically extrapolates the parameter regimes of flux pumping from the above AUG base case by scanning dissipation coefficients and plasma beta. The simulation results reveal bifurcated plasma behaviours at different Hartmann numbers, including distinct states such as flux pumping (helical core with a flat current density), sawteeth (periodic kink-cycling), single crash (without subsequent cycle), and quasi-stationary magnetic island (peaked current density). Transitions from marginal flux pumping state to sawteeth are observed in long-term simulations. The relationships between system dissipation, plasma beta, and different plasma states are carefully analyzed. For practical purposes, the potential operational window for flux pumping, as determined by plasma density and temperature, is estimated. The modelling efforts advance the understanding of flux pumping and facilitate the development of a fast surrogate model for efficient evaluation of flux pumping.",

    "abstract": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes a continuously operating, planet-scale network of atomic clocks that, beyond navigation and time dissemination, enables precision tests of fundamental physics. Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $Λ_α$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant. These limits improve upon existing astrophysical and gravity-test constraints across the ELF-energy range $\\approx10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that mature global satellite-clock networks provide an observational capability for retrospective, multi-messenger searches for new physics using decades of archival timing data.",

    "title": "A Doppler backscattering diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak: plasma considerations and preliminary quasioptical design",
    "abstract": "The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $<$ $ρ$ $<$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$<$ $k_{\\perp}$ $<$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $ρ$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\\sim35^{\\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).",

    "title": "Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications",
    "abstract": "Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.",

    "abstract": "Germanium-tin (GeSn) photodiodes potentiate a viable solution to integrate SWIR and extended SWIR detection technology into CMOS processing line. However, challenges in the growth of thick, high quality GeSn limit the device absorber thickness, making it impossible to ascertain the performance limit of GeSn photodiodes. An in-depth understanding of their device physics and a clear optimization pathway towards commercial-grade devices remain elusive. This work presents a systematic empirical study of GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber (2 to 8% Sn content, up to 2630 nm thick), showing high responsivity up to 0.59 A.W-1 at 1.55 μm and 0.43 A.W-1 at 2 μm wavelengths, low dark current density down to 2 x 10-2 A.cm-2, and high detection cutoff wavelengths up to 2.1 and 2.5 μm at 5% and 8% Sn, respectively. Using specific doping design (P-i-N and N-i-P), an in-depth analysis is presented on the impact of junction position, p-type background carrier concentration, bulk/ surface defects and photocarrier diffusion length - on photodetection performance. Different optimization strategies for GeSn photodiodes, in particular at high Sn content, are proposed.",

    "title": "Code-Verification Techniques for Particle-in-Cell Simulations with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Collisions",
    "abstract": "Particle-in-cell methods with stochastic collision models are commonly used to simulate collisional plasma dynamics, with applications ranging from hypersonic flight to semiconductor manufacturing. Code verification of such methods is challenging due to the interaction between the spatial- and temporal-discretization errors, the statistical sampling noise, and the stochastic nature of the collision algorithm. In this paper, we introduce our code-verification approaches to apply the method of manufactured solutions to plasma dynamics, and we derive expected convergence rates for the different sources of discretization and statistical error. For the particles, we incorporate the method of manufactured solutions into the equations of motion. We manufacture the particle distribution function and inversely query the cumulative distribution function to obtain known particle positions and velocities at each time step. In doing so, we avoid modifying the particle weights, eliminating risks from potentially negative weights or modifications to weight-dependent collision algorithms. For the collision algorithm, we average independent outcomes at each time step and we derive a corresponding manufactured source term for the velocity change for each particle. By having known solutions for the particle positions and velocities, we are able to compute the error in these quantities directly instead of attempting to compute differences in distribution functions. These approaches are equally valid for particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions and direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations of neutral gas flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in three dimensions for different couplings between the particles and field, with and without binary elastic collisions, and with and without coding errors.",

    "abstract": "We present the development and evaluation of a real-time Graph Neural Network-based trigger for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider. The algorithm processes calorimeter trigger cells as graph nodes to perform clustering, feature extraction, and per-cluster signal classification with deterministic latency compatible with the first-level trigger readout system. The model predicts cluster positions and energies and provides a signal classification score, enabling a more flexible clustering strategy than the baseline trigger algorithm. Implemented on an FPGA and integrated into the Belle II trigger chain for synchronous operation, the system sustains the 8 MHz trigger throughput with an end-to-end latency of 3.168 $μ$s. The performance is evaluated using simulated events and collision data. The energy resolution is comparable to the baseline trigger, while the position resolution for high-energy clusters improves by up to 18 percent in the central detector region. Cluster purity increases by up to 20 percent at low energies for isolated clusters, and cluster efficiency improves by up to 20 percent for overlapping clusters. The signal classifier enables additional background suppression at fixed signal retention. These results demonstrate the first operation of a Graph Neural Network-based reconstruction system implemented on FPGAs within the real-time trigger readout path of a collider experiment.",

The Maxwell equations, supplemented by bi-isotropic-like constitutive relations, are rewritten to describe a cold, uniform, and collisionless plasma model that yields new collective electromagnetic modes for distinct pairs of refractive indices associated with right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves. We have investigated the optical behavior through the rotatory power (RP) and dichroism coefficient, reporting that the finite chiral parameter induces double RP sign reversal, an exotic optical signature that takes place in chiral dielectrics and rotating plasmas. In the low-frequency regime, a modified propagating helicon with right-handed circular polarization is obtained. Next, supposing that the interstellar medium behaves as a chiral bi-isotropic-like cold plasma, we employ Astrophysical data of radio pulsars to achieve upper limits on the magnetoelectric parameters magnitude. In particular, by using dispersion measure and rotation measure data from five pulsars, we constrain the magnitude of the chiral parameter to the order of $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-22}$, respectively.",

    "title": "Data-driven modeling of shock physics by physics-informed MeshGraphNets",
    "abstract": "High-resolution fluid simulations for plasma physics and astrophysics rely on Particle in cell (PIC) and hydrodynamic solvers (e.g., FLASH) to resolve shock dominated, multiscale phenomena, but their high computational cost severely limits scalability. This motivates the development of learning based surrogate models, which offer a promising route to accelerate these simulations while preserving physical fidelity. In this work, we study the Sedov Taylor shock propagation problem using a physics informed graph based surrogate model, Physics Informed MeshGraphNet (PhyMGN), designed for grid-based hydrodynamics. By incorporating weak physics constraints derived from the Euler equations using finite difference method, the model captures the self similar shock evolution and associated flow structures without explicitly solving the full hydrodynamic equations at each timestep. Comparing to the baseline MeshGraphNet model, PhyMGN is able to generalize beyond the training regime with a higher accuracy and preserves differentiability in parameter space while achieving a substantial reduction in computational cost relative to conventional numerical solvers.",

    "title": "Application of RFSoC Technology for Beam Position Monitors at the SuperKEKB Storage Rings Injection Points",
    "abstract": "In order to achieve its ambitious luminosity target, the SuperKEKB collider must achieve and sustain high beam currents on the order of Ampere in its storage rings. This requires continuous top-up injection and operation with a two-bunch injection scheme, injecting two 96 ns spaced bunches in a single injection cycle. An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications. This paper is concerned with the details of this development as well as evaluation and operation of the developed device.",

    "abstract": "Laser wakefield theories rely on the laser envelope function, which is radially symmetric, and predict zero transverse momentum for the electrons along the propagation axis. Exact description of laser wakefields, beyond the envelope approximation, requires a more general formula for the Lorentz force acting on the electrons. Here we present a fundamental approach to express the transverse momentum of an electron crossing the laser pulse, and we show that an exact analytical formula can be derived for the non-zero transverse momentum of electrons initially lying along the axis of symmetry. The results outlined here shed light on the details of the electron motion inside an intense laser pulse and explain the strong wakefield asymmetry observed in simulations.",

    "abstract": "Caribou is a versatile data acquisition (DAQ) system developed within several collaborative frameworks (CERN EP R&D, DRD3, AIDAinnova, and Tangerine) to support laboratory and test-beam characterization of novel silicon pixel detectors. It combines a custom Control and Readout (CaR) board with a Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) running project-wide shared firmware and software stacks. The system architecture emphasizes reusability, flexibility, and ease of integration. The CaR board provides essential interfaces such as programmable power supplies, voltage and current references, high-speed ADCs, and configurable I/O lines for detector control and readout. The SoC runs an embedded Linux distribution built with PetaLinux and integrates two main components: Peary, a C++ embedded DAQ application providing hardware abstraction, configuration management, logging, and multi-device control through Command Line (CLI) and Python interfaces; and Boreal, a common Caribou FPGA firmware framework offering reusable modules and automated build workflows for user-specific bit files. The next major milestone in Caribou's evolution is the transition to version 2.0, based on a Zynq UltraScale+ System-on-Module (SoM) architecture. This paper presents the recent progress and future prospects of the project and describes recent hardware, firmware, and software developments preparing the system for the upcoming CaR board v2.0.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents experimental validation of the homogenized harmonic balance finite element method (HomHBFEM), which we have developed as a dedicated simulation technique for magnets with fast excitation cycles, in particular the fast corrector (FC) magnets for PETRA IV at DESY. The HomHBFEM allows efficient three-dimensional nonlinear eddy-current simulations of laminated magnets at elevated frequencies with a relatively coarse finite element (FE) mesh and without computationally expensive time-stepping. This is achieved by combining a frequency-domain-based homogenization technique with the harmonic balance FE method. The simulation results for the magnetic flux density along the axis of the FC magnets as a function of frequency and the resulting integrated transfer function (ITF) are compared to Hall probe and search coil measurements of the first prototype FC magnet for PETRA IV. A good agreement between simulated and measured ITFs is achieved for excitation frequencies from 10 Hz to 10 kHz.",

    "title": "Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties",
    "abstract": "X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based attenuation of narrow-band fluctuations to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus substantially reducing the burden of computational cost required for XRTS analysis.",

    "title": "Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout",
    "abstract": "We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.",

    "abstract": "We present TokaMind, an open-source foundation model framework for fusion plasma modeling, based on a Multi-Modal Transformer (MMT) and trained on heterogeneous tokamak diagnostics from the publicly available MAST dataset. TokaMind supports multiple data modalities (time-series, 2D profiles, and videos) with different sampling rates, robust missing-signal handling, and efficient task adaptation via selectively loading and freezing four model components. To represent multi-modal signals, we use a training-free Discrete Cosine Transform embedding (DCT3D) and provide a clean interface for alternative embeddings (e.g., Variational Autoencoders - VAEs). We evaluate TokaMind on the recently introduced MAST benchmark TokaMark, comparing training and embedding strategies. Our results show that fine-tuned TokaMind outperforms the benchmark baseline on all but one task, and that, for several tasks, lightweight fine-tuning yields better performance than training the same architecture from scratch under a matched epoch budget. These findings highlight the benefits of multi-modal pretraining for tokamak plasma dynamics and provide a practical, extensible foundation for future fusion modeling tasks. Training code and model weights will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Good fast-ion confinement is an essential requirement for a fusion reactor. The magnetic configuration of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator is partially optimized in this regard in a reactor-relevant scenario: it is expected to show improved fast-ion confinement when $β$ is high and the effect of the radial electric field is negligible. The experimental validation of this optimization is difficult since, with the available power, achieving high $β$ under appropriate conditions for the validation is challenging and the effect of the radial electric field is inevitable. In this work, the confinement of fast ions in W7-X has been studied numerically for a variety of scenarios via the ASCOT5 code. The effect of the radial electric field on fast-ion losses is confirmed to be equivalent to the one produced by $β$, and this is characterized by means of scans on both parameters. Through a preliminary study with experimentally-based profiles, a viable scenario is identified that takes advantage of this effect for the experimental validation of the optimization strategy of W7-X.",

    "title": "First Experimental Demonstration of Beam Storage by Three-Dimensional Spiral Injection Scheme for Ultra-Compact Storage Rings",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional spiral injection enables beam storage in ultra-compact rings with nanosecond revolution periods. We report first storage of a $297 \\, \\mathrm{keV/}c$ electron beam in a $22 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$ weak-focusing ring with a $4.7\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ revolution period using a $140\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ kicker pulse. A scintillating-fiber detector observes signals $>5σ$ above noise for $\\geq 1\\, \\mathrm{μs}$, and varying the weak-focusing field potential shifts the stored-beam region, consistent with Monte Carlo predictions, validating beam storage. This proof-of-principle opens a path to ultra-compact storage rings for next-generation precision measurements.",

    "title": "Compositional Metrology of Atom Probe Applied to non-Metallic Materials",
    "abstract": "Two decades after its introduction, laser-assisted Atom Probe Tomography (La-APT) has demonstrated a unique potential for the study of the 3D distribution of atomic species in semiconductor materials and devices, and in a growing list of inorganic non-metallic solids. A crucial and often underestimated issue with APT is its accuracy in compositional measurements of non-metallic systems. This work introduces the principles of APT as an experimental technique, recalling the aspects potentially leading to compositional biases and underlining in particular the role of the surface electric field in governing the different physical-chemical phenomena that enable the measurement. It reviews the possible mechanisms of specific losses, as well as the methods for assessing a compositional bias and proposing possible correction methods. Finally, it establishes a state of the art on compositional biases in APT of non-metallic materials, on the basis of which it will be possible to conclude on specific recommendations for best practices, and the perspective of application of APT to new materials.",

    "abstract": "We present the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a radio-frequency based time-to-position conversion system for keV electrons incorporating a helical deflector operating in the 400-1000 MHz range. The device performs circular deflection of the electrons when driven by a single RF frequency and enables spiral scanning when two phase-locked RF voltages with slightly different frequencies are applied. The superposition of the two phase-locked RF voltages produces an amplitude-beating field whose slowly varying envelope modulates the deflection radius, transforming the circular scan into a controlled spiral on the detector plane. A detailed theoretical model describing the electron dynamics under two phase-locked RF voltages with different frequencies was derived, yielding analytical expressions for the transverse velocity and radius-vector components at the deflector exit. Spiral scanning will allow measurements with picosecond resolution in a time range 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the period of the circular scanning.",

    "title": "Effective Caldirola-Kanai Model for Accelerating Twisted Dirac States in Nonuniform Axial Fields",
    "abstract": "We study relativistic twisted (orbital-angular-momentum) states of a massive charged particle propagating through an axially symmetric, longitudinally inhomogeneous solenoid field and a co-directed accelerating or decelerating electric field. Starting from the Dirac equation and using controlled spinless and paraxial approximations, we show that the transverse envelope obeys an effective nonstationary Schrödinger equation governed by a Caldirola--Kanai Hamiltonian. The longitudinal energy gain or loss encoded in $f(z)=[E_0-V(z)]^2-m^2$ generates an effective gain or damping rate $\\widetildeγ(z)=\\partial_z f(z)/[2f(z)]$ and a $z$-dependent oscillator frequency $\\widetildeω(z)=p_0Ω(z)/\\sqrt{f(z)}$. Exploiting the Ermakov mapping (unitary equivalence of Caldirola--Kanai systems), we obtain a closed-form propagated twisted wave function by transforming the stationary Landau basis. The transverse evolution is controlled by a single scaling function $b(z)$ that satisfies a generalized Ermakov--Pinney equation with coefficients determined by $E_z(z)$ and $B_z(z)$. In the limiting cases of uniform acceleration with $B_z=0$ and of solenoid focusing with negligible acceleration, our solution reduces to previously known analytic results, providing a direct bridge to established models.",

    "abstract": "The generation of relativistic vortex electron beams via photoemission requires ultraviolet laser beams with well-controlled orbital angular momentum (OAM) and compatibility with radio-frequency (RF) photoinjector drive-laser systems. High-OAM vortex beams at a wavelength of 266 nm are generated using three fabricated diffractive optical elements integrated into an operational photoinjector beamline: a reflective fork grating, a high-topological-charge spiral phase plate, and binary axicons. The spiral phase plate produces a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with an OAM of l = 64 and a conversion efficiency of 80%, whereas binary axicons generate low-divergence quasi-Bessel beams forming a superposition of multiple OAM states with a finite OAM bandwidth imposed by their binary phase structure. Fork gratings provide flexible access to lower OAM values and enable robust modal diagnostics. The generated beams are characterized using cylindrical-lens mode conversion and radial intensity analysis, demonstrating practical control of both the OAM content and spectral bandwidth of ultraviolet structured light for accelerator-based applications.",

We propose and analyze a flat-bottomed hollow-beam ponderomotive optical trap for an ultracold neutral plasma (UNP), driven by a high-power CO$_2$ laser. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the plasma and Rydberg atoms are effectively trapped within a nearly uniform dark region bounded by repulsive light walls. In contrast to RF traps, flat-bottomed traps yield a small density-weighted mean ponderomotive energy per electron, while the UNP collision frequency is far below the laser frequency, thereby making collisional absorption negligible and does not limit the lifetime of the trap. This approach could enhance antimatter production and storage.",

    "abstract": "The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.",

Nevertheless, few authors have explicitly used these concepts in publications on fusion plasmas. The small number of plasma physicists who have an intuitive understanding of these concepts retards or blocks development in a number of areas: magnetic reconnection, the most important electromagnetic correction to what are called electrostatic micro-instabilities, non-resonant divertors in stellarators, disruptions and damage from runaway electrons in tokamaks. Physicists become interested in new mathematical concepts when they give insights into and solutions to practical problems.

    "title": "GW-FALCON: A Novel Feature-Driven Deep Learning Approach for Early Warning Alerts of BNS and NSBH Inspirals in Next-Generation GW Observatories",
    "abstract": "Next-generation GW observatories such as the ET and CE will detect BNS and NSBH inspirals with high SNRs and long in-band durations, making systematic early-warning alerts both feasible and scientifically valuable. Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.",

    "title": "ARAPUCA, light trapping device for the DUNE experiment",
    "abstract": "The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be the first mega-science program on the US soil and will shade light on some of the open questions in neutrino physics. The experiment foresees the realization of an intense neutrino beam at Fermilab (Chicago - USA), of a near detector to monitor the beam and a far detector installed in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), 1300 km far away. Four 10 kt Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) will compose the 40 kt far detector modules to perform the precise measurements required for DUNE. The experimental technique uses charge and light signal from ionizing radiations in liquid argon to fully reconstruct neutrino interactions with excellent spatial resolution, calorimetric measurements and particle identification.   The liquid argon scintillation light is produced around 127 nm within a few nanoseconds from the radiation passage. Its detection may improve the LArTPC calorimetric besides giving the time stamp of non-beam events, which is vital in fiducializing nucleon-decay events. The DUNE Photon Detection System (PDS) is responsible to efficiently collect this light in order to fiducialize the active volume of the detector with $>99\\%$ efficiency. The PDS will be composed by 1,500 X-ARAPUCA modules, a light trapping device that was the main subject of this thesis.   In this work, the research and development of the ARAPUCA devices will be presented. The full characterization of the prototypes were performed in dedicated liquid argon tests, in Brazil and Italy, where comparable efficiencies of (2.2 $\\pm$ 0.4)% and (1.9 $\\pm$ 0.1)% were found. A new wavelength shifter developed in Italy in collaboration with the Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca will be presented. It allowed to increase the light detection efficiency of about 50% and resulted in an overall efficiency of (2.9 $\\pm$ 0.1)% of the X-ARAPUCA.",
