  "title": "Asymmetry in laser wakefields driven by intense pulses",
  "abstract": "Laser wakefield theories rely on the laser envelope function, which is radially symmetric, and predict zero transverse momentum for the electrons along the propagation axis. Exact description of laser wakefields, beyond the envelope approximation, requires a more general formula for the Lorentz force acting on the electrons. Here we present a fundamental approach to express the transverse momentum of an electron crossing the laser pulse, and we show that an exact analytical formula can be derived for the non-zero transverse momentum of electrons initially lying along the axis of symmetry. The results outlined here shed light on the details of the electron motion inside an intense laser pulse and explain the strong wakefield asymmetry observed in simulations.",
