  "title": "Hanbury Brown-Twiss interference with massively parallel spectral multiplexing for broadband light",
  "abstract": "Two-photon interference is a fundamental resource for quantum technologies and optical quantum computing, underpinning precision measurements, scalable entanglement distribution, and the operation of photonic circuits and quantum network protocols. Here, we report the first demonstration of massively parallel, wavelength-resolved photon bunching, revealing Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations across 100 independent spectral channels. These observations are enabled by a fast, data-driven single-photon spectrometer that achieves 40 pm spectral and 40 ps temporal resolution over a 10 nm bandwidth, providing simultaneous access to spectro-temporal photon correlations without the need for narrowband filtering. This approach preserves photon flux while enabling high-dimensional quantum interference measurements across a broad spectrum. Our results establish frequency-multiplexed two-photon interference as a scalable and throughput-efficient platform for quantum-enhanced photonic technologies, offering a practical route toward room-temperature architectures that overcome loss limitations and advance the scalability for a variety of applications.",
