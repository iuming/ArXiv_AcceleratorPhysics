  "title": "CCAT: Magnetic Sensitivity Measurements of Kinetic Inductance Detectors",
  "abstract": "The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.",
