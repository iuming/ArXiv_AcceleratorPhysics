  "title": "Magnetic Field Line Chaos, Cantori, and Turnstiles in Toroidal Plasmas",
  "abstract": "The mathematical concepts of chaos, cartori, and turnstiles underlie a number of areas of tokamak and stellarator physics. Nevertheless, few authors have explicitly used these concepts in publications on fusion plasmas. The small number of plasma physicists who have an intuitive understanding of these concepts retards or blocks development in a number of areas: magnetic reconnection, the most important electromagnetic correction to what are called electrostatic micro-instabilities, non-resonant divertors in stellarators, disruptions and damage from runaway electrons in tokamaks. Physicists become interested in new mathematical concepts when they give insights into and solutions to practical problems. The importance of this review is not only in explaining chaos, cartori, and turnstiles as mathematical concepts but also in illustrating their significance through applications.",
