  "title": "Development of a Modular ODMR Setup for Optical Experiments in a Variable Temperature Insert",
  "abstract": "We developed an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) setup designed for compatibility with a widely used, commercially available helium bath cryostat equipped with a variable temperature insert. The optical path extends nearly two meters, spanning the full length of the cryostat insert, enabling excitation of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and detection of the resulting fluorescence from outside the cryostat. The setup preserves optical alignment and beam quality along this extended path allowing integration into existing cryogenic systems without significant modifications. We demonstrate the setup's performance by measuring the temperature dependence of the resonance signal and its behavior under small applied magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic transition of a SrRuO$_3$ sample, thereby showcasing the feasibility of NV magnetometry on a sample in constrained cryogenic environments.",
