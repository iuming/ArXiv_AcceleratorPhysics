  "title": "The program Simourg for simulating the response functions of gamma detectors with simple geometries",
  "abstract": "The program Simourg (Simulator of Usually Requested Geometries) is based on the Geant4 toolkit and created for Monte Carlo simulation of gamma-ray spectrometric nuclear detectors with a simple axial symmetric geometry, which is typical for many tasks of studying the decay of long-lived nuclei and measuring the radioactivity of natural objects. The program is designed for quick estimation of the effectiveness and the response function of the detector to monoenergetic gamma quanta in the energy range from keV to several MeV.",
