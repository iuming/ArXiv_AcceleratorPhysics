  "title": "Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors based on NbRe nitride   ultrafilms",
  "abstract": "The influence of the reactive DC sputtering parameters on the superconducting properties of NbReN ultrathin films was investigated. A detailed study of the current-voltage characteristics of the plasma was performed to optimize the superconducting critical temperature, Tc. The thickness dependence of Tc for the films deposited under different conditions was analyzed down to the ultrathin limit. Optimized films were used to fabricate superconducting nanowire single photon detectors which, at T=3.5 K, show saturated internal detection efficiency (IDE) up to a wavelength of 1301 nm and 95% IDE at 1548 nm with recovery times and timing jitter of about 8 ns and 28 ps, respectively.",
