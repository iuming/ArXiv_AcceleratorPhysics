  "title": "Low-energy Cross Section Measurements of   ${}^{\\mathsf{12}}\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{p},Î³)$ Deep Underground at LUNA",
  "abstract": "The ${}^{\\mathsf{12}}\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{p},\\gamma)$ reaction cross section is currently under investigation in the low-background environment of the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). It is being studied using different types of solid targets, and employing two complementary detection techniques: HPGe spectroscopy and activation counting. To reduce systematic uncertainties, targets have been accurately characterized and their degradation under the intense beam of the LUNA-400 accelerator monitored. We present the experimental techniques and the corresponding analyses used to extract the reaction cross section.",
