    "title": "Developing a Cost-Effective Spectrometer: A Practical Approach",
    "abstract": "The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating & Python (a free, open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.",

    "title": "GyroSwin: 5D Surrogates for Gyrokinetic Plasma Turbulence Simulations",
    "abstract": "Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the nonlinear lattice design approach for the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) storage ring. By suppressing chaos, we identify alternative sextupole configurations to the original design, which relied on the conventional strategy of simultaneously minimizing Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) and Amplitude-Dependent Detuning (ADD). These alternatives achieve comparable performance while requiring fewer sextupoles. A detailed comparison of two representative solutions is presented and supported by experimental validation. Our results show that the dynamic aperture correlates more strongly with global chaos than with individual RDTs, and that the importance of minimizing ADD may have been overstated in earlier design strategies.",

    "abstract": "We present a structure-preserving discretization of the hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-driftkinetic system for simulations of low-frequency wave-particle interactions. The model equations are derived from a variational principle, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and driftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a finite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a particle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme is the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in the Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The resulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into skew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the non-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based on discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python package $\\texttt{STRUPHY}$. Numerical experiments confirm the energy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to simulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\\'en eigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This capability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for high-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems.",

    "title": "Chaotic Motion of Ions In Finite-amplitude Low-frequency Alfvén Waves",
    "abstract": "Finite-amplitude low-frequency Alfv\\'en waves (AWs) are commonly found in plasma environments, such as space plasmas, and play a crucial role in ion heating. In this study, we examine the nonlinear interactions between monochromatic AWs and ions. When the wave amplitude and propagation angle lie within certain ranges, particle motion becomes chaotic. We quantify this chaotic behavior using the maximum Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda_m$, and find that chaos depends on the particles' initial states. To characterize the proportion of chaotic particles across different initial states, we introduce the Chaos Ratio ($CR$). The threshold for the onset of global chaos is calculated as the contour line of $CR=0.01$. We analyze changes in the magnetic moment during particle motion and identify the physical image of chaos as pitch-angle scattering caused by wave-induced field line curvature (WFLC). Consequently, the condition for chaos can be expressed as the effective relative curvature radius $P_{eff.}<C$, with $C$ being a constant. We analytically determine the chaos region in the $(k_x,\\,k_z,\\,B_w)$ parameter space, and the results show excellent agreement with the global chaos threshold given by $CR=0.01$.",

    "title": "Unveiling a New $β$-Scaling of the Tearing Instability in Weakly   Collisional Plasmas",
    "abstract": "We investigate the linear tearing instability in weakly collisional plasmas using a non-ideal gyrotropic-MHD framework, uncovering a previously unknown scaling relation for the instability growth rate in high-$\\beta$ environments. Even starting from an isotropic equilibrium, our analysis reveals a $\\beta$-dependence, with the maximum growth rate scaling as $\\sigma_\\mathrm{max} \\tau_a \\propto \\beta^{-1/4}$, challenging the long-held assumption of $\\beta$-independence inherent in classical MHD formulations. This novel scaling emerges due to self-consistent fluctuations in pressure anisotropy, dynamically induced by perturbations in velocity and magnetic fields. Increasing plasma-$\\beta$ always suppresses the instability, whereas a background pressure anisotropy can either enhance or further suppress it, depending on its sign: for $p_{\\parallel,0} < p_{\\perp,0}$ the instability is strengthened, while for $p_{\\parallel,0} > p_{\\perp,0}$ it is weakened. Importantly, this effect is not limited to low-collisionality plasmas at high $\\beta$; it can also manifest in more collisional environments once the strict assumption of pressure isotropy is relaxed. This finding has profound implications for various astrophysical contexts characterized by high $\\beta$ and varying degrees of collisionality, including the solar corona and heliospheric current sheets, planetary magnetospheres, as probed by space missions, and the intracluster medium, where magnetic reconnection critically impacts magnetic field evolution and cosmic ray transport. Our results therefore question the universality of the widely-accepted plasmoid-mediated fast reconnection paradigm and underscore the necessity of incorporating pressure anisotropy effects into reconnection models for accurate representation of astrophysical plasmas.",

    "title": "Determining the 3D Dynamics of Solar Flare Magnetic Reconnection",
    "abstract": "Solar flares are major space weather events that result from the explosive conversion of stored magnetic energy into bulk motion, plasma heating, and particle acceleration. While the standard flare model has proven highly successful in explaining key morphological features of flare observations, many aspects of the energy release are not yet understood. In particular, the turbulent three-dimensional structure of the flare current sheet is thought to play an important role in fast reconnection, particle acceleration, and bursty dynamics. Although direct diagnosis of the magnetic field dynamics in the corona remains highly challenging, rich information may be gleaned from flare ribbons, which represent the chromospheric imprints of reconnection in the corona. Intriguingly, recent solar imaging observations have revealed a diversity of fine structure in flare ribbons that hints at corresponding complexity in the reconnection region. We present high-resolution three-dimensional MHD simulations of an eruptive flare and describe our efforts to interpret fine-scale ribbon features in terms of the current sheet dynamics. In our model, the current sheet is characterized by many coherent magnetic structures known as plasmoids. We derive a model analogue for ribbons by generating a time series of field-line length maps (L-maps) and identifying abrupt shortenings as flare reconnection events. We thereby demonstrate that plasmoids imprint transient 'spirals' along the analogue of the ribbon front, with a morphology consistent with observed fine structure. We discuss the implications of these results for interpreting SolO, IRIS, and DKIST observations of explosive flare energy release.",

Operating near a dark fringe with active phase-locking, combined with amplitude modulation, the interferometer converts axion-induced photon disappearance into a measurable signal. A 2 W, 1550 nm laser is coupled into a 1 m-long HC-PCF placed inside a 2 T permanent magnet array, probing a fixed axion mass of $m_a \\simeq 49~$meV with a projected sensitivity of $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma} \\gtrsim 1.3 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for a measurement time of 30 days.

Due to the strain sensitivity of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxides), adapting it to non-planar stellarator geometries requires new winding, structural, and cooling strategies. We report on the results of a staged prototype program (P1, P2, P3) employing 3D-printed, sectional aluminum coil frames with winding channels, gimballed constant-tension winding mechanics, and solder potting for radial current redistribution and passive quench mitigation. The first prototype, P1 (planar elliptical, double-pancake) tested additive manufacture, sectional joining and baseline winding, achieving predicted fields at 77 K. P2 (non-planar, higher strain) was wound to 42 turns, energized at 30-40 K to produce expected magnetic fields, and studied thermal gradients and resistance at up to 4.5 kAt. Design evolution in P3 introduces concave geometry with dual double-pancakes, 200 turns, and approaches the 70 kAt target at 20 K. In parallel, sub-microhm lap joints have been developed. Together, these results de-risk manufacturing, cooling interfaces, quench management, and diagnostics, paving the way for full-size non-planar HTS stellarator coils for CSX.",

However, copper is ductile and of limited mechanical strength posing challenges for its use in future experiments. Electroformed copper-based alloys have been identified as a promising solution. However, their synthesis needs refining by exploring a complex parameter space of compositions and strengthening mechanisms. Here we show how a materials design approach may address current challenges and optimize alloy synthesis and processing. Alloy properties are predicted following thermal processing, using computational thermodynamics. The findings suggest a methodology to design high-performance, radiopure copper-based alloys suitable for next-generation rare-event experiments, while minimizing lengthy and expensive trial-and-error approaches.

    "abstract": "This contribution presents the design, production, and initial testing of newly developed 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs). The evaluation includes performance metrics such as the internal gain layer's efficiency in enhancing signal generation. Initial laboratory and Transient Current Technique (TCT) measurements provide insight into the device's stability and response to the signal.   Due to the increase of availability provided by the industry, 4H-SiC is emerging as a strong candidate for the next-generation of semiconductor detectors. Such sensors are promising due to the inherent radiation tolerance of 4H-SiC and its stable operation across a wide temperature range. However, due to the wider-bandgap of 4H-SiC compared to standard silicon, and difficulty to produce high-quality layers thicker than 50 \\textmu m, an internal charge multiplication layer needs to be introduced.   The presented 4H-SiC LGADs, fabricated by onsemi, are optimized for an N-type substrate and epi wafer. The initial TCT and laboratory test results demonstrate fast charge collection and uniform multiplication across multiple samples produced on a single wafer.",

    "abstract": "CO$_2$ with an admixture of C$_4$F$_7$N could serve as an eco-friendly alternative to the extreme greenhouse gas SF$_6$ in high-voltage insulation. Streamer discharges in such gases are different from those in air due to the rapid conductivity decay in the streamer channels. Furthermore, since no effective photoionisation mechanism is known, we expect discharge growth to be more stochastic than in air. In this paper we investigate whether conventional fluid models can be used to simulate streamers in CO$_2$ with admixtures of C$_4$F$_7$N of 1 or 10%. We focus on 3D simulations of negative streamers. First we review cross section databases for C$_4$F$_7$N and CO$_2$. Then we compare a two-term Boltzmann solver with a Monte Carlo method to compute reaction and transport coefficients from the cross sections. Afterwards we compare 3D fluid simulations with the local field (LFA) or local energy approximation (LEA) against particle simulations. In general, we find that the results of particle and fluid models are quite similar. One difference we observe is that particle simulations are intrinsically stochastic, leading to more branching. Furthermore, the LEA model does not show better agreement with the particle simulations than the LFA model. We also discuss the effect and choice of different boundary conditions on the negative rod electrode.",

Regarding (1), we argue that the main geometric quantities of interest are the notion of reach and the volume of the region enclosed by the coils. Our main finding is a quantitative formula which shows that the larger the reach and the smaller the volume of the region enclosed by the coils, the smaller is the influence of the electric current uncertainty on the magnetic fields.

    "title": "Low-noise Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Enabled by Superconducting   On-Chip Filterbank Spectrometers",
    "abstract": "Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10--100 with surveys of $10^5$--$10^6$ spectrometer hours.",

    "title": "Modular Reactor for In Situ X-ray Scattering, Spectroscopy, and ATR-IR   Studies of Solvothermal Nanoparticle Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Understanding the chemical processes that occur during the solvothermal synthesis of functional nanomaterials is essential for their rational design and optimization for specific applications. However, these processes remain poorly understood, primarily due to the limitations of conventional ex situ characterization techniques and the technical challenges associated with in situ studies, particularly the design and implementation of suitable reactors. Here, we present a versatile cell suitable for in situ X-ray scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy studies performed during solvothermal synthesis under autoclave-like, inert conditions. The reactor enables precise control of the temperature between -20 C and 200 C, pressures up to 8 bar, magnetic stirring, and injection of gas or liquids. The reactor's capabilities are demonstrated by comprehensively studying the solvothermal synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles from iron acetylacetonate in benzyl alcohol through in situ X-ray scattering and spectroscopy, and ATR-IR spectroscopy.",

    "title": "M5 -- Mars Magnetospheric Multipoint Measurement Mission: A   multi-spacecraft plasma physics mission to Mars",
    "abstract": "Mars, lacking an intrinsic dynamo, is an ideal laboratory to comparatively study induced magnetospheres, which can be found in other terrestrial bodies as well as comets. Additionally, Mars is of particular interest to further exploration due to its loss of habitability by atmospheric escape and possible future human exploration. In this context, we propose the Mars Magnetospheric Multipoint Measurement Mission (M$^5$), a multi-spacecraft mission to study the dynamics and energy transport of the Martian induced magnetosphere comprehensively. Particular focus is dedicated to the largely unexplored magnetotail region, where signatures of magnetic reconnection have been found. Furthermore, a reliable knowledge of the upstream solar wind conditions is needed to study the dynamics of the Martian magnetosphere, especially the different dayside boundary regions but also for energy transport phenomena like the current system and plasma waves. This will aid the study of atmospheric escape processes of planets with induced magnetospheres. In order to resolve the three-dimensional structures varying both in time and space, multi-point measurements are required. Thus, M$^5$ is a five spacecraft mission, with one solar wind monitor orbiting Mars in a circular orbit at 5 Martian radii, and four smaller spacecraft in a tetrahedral configuration orbiting Mars in an elliptical orbit, spanning the far magnetotail up to 6 Mars radii with a periapsis within the Martian magnetosphere of 1.8 Mars radii. We not only present a detailed assessment of the scientific need for such a mission but also show the resulting mission and spacecraft design taking into account all aspects of the mission requirements and constraints such as mass, power, and link budgets. This mission concept was developed during the Alpbach Summer School 2022.",

    "title": "A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in   EMC3",
    "abstract": "One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \\varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.",

    "title": "The potential applications of muography to revealing sea shipwrecks",
    "abstract": "Muon imaging, a non-invasive technique that utilizes naturally occurring cosmic muons, has emerged as a promising tool for exploring underwater objects, including shipwrecks. This study investigates the potential of muon radiography to examine the contents of wrecked ships in the Baltic Sea and other marine environments. These wrecks often pose significant environmental risks due to hazardous contents such as explosives and crude oil, making their detection and monitoring critical for environmental and safety considerations. Accurate modeling and imaging of such wrecks are therefore essential for assessing potential dangers and mitigating environmental impacts.   To model the underwater muon flux in this study, an approach similar to that used in underground muon experiments was adopted. Cosmic muons were propagated through seawater using GEANT4, modeling their energy loss as they traverse water. The muons' kinematics and energy depositions were recorded during this process. The resulting distributions were tabulated and used as input for the primary particle generation module. This method enabled the generation of a realistic underwater muon flux at the desired depth above the shipwreck, allowing us to simulate various shipwreck filling scenarios.   Assuming an exposure time of one week for a wreck located at 50 meters depth, our simulations demonstrate that muon imaging can sufficiently resolve density contrasts to distinguish between water, oil, and high-density materials. These results demonstrate the feasibility of muon radiography as a practical tool for underwater hazard assessment and shipwreck investigation.",

    "abstract": "One of the most promising approaches for future neutrinoless double beta decay searches is to incorporate a candidate isotope into the liquid scintillator of a next-generation neutrino detector. In this study, a sample of the high-performance 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene-based liquid scintillator from the Borexino detector was loaded with different concentrations of Te-diols. Therefore,a novel and completely water-free synthesis in a non-acidic organic environment at room temperature was used. Key parameters of the loaded samples were analyzed and compared with those of the pure Borexino liquid. Both the emission spectrum and transmission remained nearly unchanged,even at high doping levels. The reduction in light yield was moderate, with approximately 8,400 photons emitted for a 1 MeV energy deposition by an electron at 1$\\%$ tellurium loading. The time profile of the light emission induced by alpha particles was also investigated, revealing that the scintillation response becomes significantly faster with increasing tellurium concentration.",

    "title": "Wave Topology in Hall MHD",
    "abstract": "Hall Magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) extends ideal MHD by incorporating the Hall effect via the induction equation, making it more accurate for describing plasma behavior at length scales below the ion skin depth. Despite its importance, a comprehensive description of the eigenmodes in HMHD has been lacking. In this work, we derive the complete spectrum and eigenvectors of HMHD waves and identify their underlying topological structure. We prove that the HMHD wave spectrum is homotopic to that of ideal MHD, consisting of three distinct branches: the slow magnetosonic-Hall waves, the shear Alfv\\'en-Hall waves, and the fast magnetosonic-Hall waves, which continuously reduce to their ideal MHD counterparts in the limit of vanishing Hall parameter. Contrary to a recent claim, we find that HMHD does not admit any additional wave branches beyond those in ideal MHD. The key qualitative difference lies in the topological nature of the HMHD wave structure: it exhibits nontrivial topology characterized by a Weyl point-an isolated eigenmode degeneracy point-and associated nonzero Chern numbers of the eigenmode bundles over a 2-sphere in k-space surrounding the Weyl point.",

    "title": "Sensor Co-design for $\\textit{smartpixels}$",
    "abstract": "Pixel tracking detectors at upcoming collider experiments will see unprecedented charged-particle densities. Real-time data reduction on the detector will enable higher granularity and faster readout, possibly enabling the use of the pixel detector in the first level of the trigger for a hadron collider. This data reduction can be accomplished with a neural network (NN) in the readout chip bonded with the sensor that recognizes and rejects tracks with low transverse momentum (p$_T$) based on the geometrical shape of the charge deposition (``cluster''). To design a viable detector for deployment at an experiment, the dependence of the NN as a function of the sensor geometry, external magnetic field, and irradiation must be understood. In this paper, we present first studies of the efficiency and data reduction for planar pixel sensors exploring these parameters. A smaller sensor pitch in the bending direction improves the p$_T$ discrimination, but a larger pitch can be partially compensated with detector depth. An external magnetic field parallel to the sensor plane induces Lorentz drift of the electron-hole pairs produced by the charged particle, broadening the cluster and improving the network performance. The absence of the external field diminishes the background rejection compared to the baseline by $\\mathcal{O}$(10%). Any accumulated radiation damage also changes the cluster shape, reducing the signal efficiency compared to the baseline by $\\sim$ 30 - 60%, but nearly all of the performance can be recovered through retraining of the network and updating the weights. Finally, the impact of noise was investigated, and retraining the network on noise-injected datasets was found to maintain performance within 6% of the baseline network trained and evaluated on noiseless data.",

    "title": "Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman   Filters",
    "abstract": "Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such a low-temperature environment, which may further affect inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. As these modes remain a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.",

    "title": "Semi-Implicit Continuum Kinetic Modeling of Weakly Collisional Parallel   Transport in a Magnetic Mirror",
    "abstract": "We present implicit-explicit (IMEX) kinetic simulations of weakly collisional parallel plasma transport in magnetic mirror configurations using the continuum code \\textsc{COGENT}. The numerical scheme employs a Jacobian-free Newton--Krylov method with algebraic multigrid preconditioning to overcome the severe time-step limitations imposed by strong mirror forces in fully explicit schemes. Applied to parameters relevant to the WHAM mirror experiment, the IMEX approach enables time steps up to $2.5 \\times 10^4$ times larger than those permitted by explicit methods, resulting in a 2500x speedup in 1D--2V simulations of parallel transport with kinetic ions and Boltzmann electrons. Additionally, a reduced bounce-averaged model for a square mirror is implemented to support the computationally intensive fully kinetic simulations. The bounce-averaged formulation is used to evaluate the numerical convergence of the velocity-space discretization algorithms and to assess the role of the collision model by comparing simulations employing the nonlinear Fokker--Planck and the simplified Lenard--Bernstein--Dougherty collision operators.",

    "title": "Long wave infrared detection using probabilistic spintronic bolometer   arrays",
    "abstract": "The use of probabilistic spintronic devices for infrared radiation detection has introduced a shift in approach to thermal imaging. The integration of probabilistic magnetic tunnel junctions with infrared plasmonic nano-antennas achieves high-sensitivity digital-mode infrared sensors at room temperature. Here, we present a scalable approach towards multipixel plasmonic-spintronic bolometer array fabrication and readout. We fabricate proof-of-concept 2x2 row-column multiplexed probabilistic plasmonic sprintronic arrays and show their response to long-wave infrared radiation (8-14um) with high readout speeds (10K-1M counts per second). These spintronic, ultrafast, nanoscale (SUN) bolometers can result in novel high-pixel density CMOS compatible infrared detection platforms. Our work provides a broadband (9kHz to 3GHz) readout platform for future digital probabilistic detector applications. Furthermore, our approach addresses a key challenge associated with scaling infrared pixel sizes that can drive progress towards high pixel density detector arrays for infrared sensing and microscopy applications.",

    "title": "The impact of Alfvenic shear flow on magnetic reconnection and   turbulence",
    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.",

    "title": "Influence of Solar Sails on Magnetic Field Measurements in Space Plasmas",
    "abstract": "Solar sail technology is ready to be deployed in a satellite mission carrying a science-grade magnetometer. In preparation for such a mission, it is essential to characterize the interactions between the sail and the ambient plasma that could affect the magnetometer readings. The solar wind magnetic field is a key parameter in space weather prediction, because it governs the energy-releasing magnetic reconnection process at Earth's magnetopause. This paper investigates the influence of solar sails on the ambient magnetic field, particularly focusing on two critical electromagnetic effects: eddy currents and magnetic pileup. We find the induced eddy currents in the metallic sail can significantly perturb the local magnetic field at high frequencies. We also suggest that magnetic pileup can influence the spacecraft's environment when the sail size is comparable to the electron kinetic scales of the surrounding plasma. This research provides an initial guide for determining when sail-plasma interactions could impact magnetometer performance.",

    "title": "Study of few-electron backgrounds in the LUX-ZEPLIN detector",
    "abstract": "The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment aims to detect rare interactions between dark matter particles and xenon. Although the detector is designed to be the most sensitive to GeV/$c^2$--TeV/$c^2$ Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it is also capable of measuring low-energy ionization signals down to a single electron that may be produced by scatters of sub-GeV/$c^2$ dark matter. The major challenge in exploiting this sensitivity is to understand and suppress the ionization background in the few-electron regime. We report a characterization of the delayed electron backgrounds following energy depositions in the LZ detector under different detector conditions. In addition, we quantify the probability for photons to be emitted in coincidence with electron emission from the high voltage grids. We then demonstrate that spontaneous grid electron emission can be identified and rejected with a high efficiency using a coincident photon tag, which provides a tool to improve the sensitivity of future dark matter searches.",

    "title": "CCAT: Readout of over 10,000 280 GHz KIDs in Mod-Cam using RFSoC   Electronics",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) have emerged as a viable superconducting technology for astrophysics at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. KIDs spanning 210 - 850 GHz across seven instrument modules will be deployed in the Prime-Cam instrument of CCAT Observatory's Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope at an elevation of 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in Chile's Atacama Desert. The natural frequency-division multiplexed readout of KIDs allows hundreds of detectors to be coupled to a single radio frequency (RF) transmission line, but requires sophisticated warm readout electronics. The FPGA-based Xilinx ZCU111 radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC) offers a promising and flexible solution to the challenge of warm readout. CCAT uses custom packaged RFSoCs to read out KIDs in the Prime-Cam instrument. Each RFSoC can simultaneously read out four RF channels with up to 1,000 detectors spanning a 512 MHz bandwidth per channel using the current firmware. We use five RFSoCs to read out the >10,000 KIDs in the broadband 280 GHz instrument module inside a testbed receiver. Here, we describe and demonstrate the readout software and pipeline for the RFSoC system. We also present the preliminary averaged spectral responses of the 280 GHz instrument module using KIDs from the TiN array and the first Al array as a demonstration of the end-to-end performance of the readout and optical systems. These measurements demonstrate the foundation that will enable us to simultaneously read out over 10,000 KIDs with the RFSoC and represent a critical step toward reading out the ~100,000 KIDs in Prime-Cam in its future full capacity configuration.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoconvection at the solar surface governs the dynamics in the upper solar atmosphere and sustains the heliosphere. Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40 Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20 m s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.",

    "title": "Simulation of Muon-induced Backgrounds for the Colorado Underground   Research Institute (CURIE)",
    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of muon-induced backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), a shallow-underground facility with $\\approx 415$~m.w.e. overburden. Using coupled \\textsc{mute} and \\textsc{geant4} frameworks, we characterize the production and transport of muon-induced secondaries through site-specific rock compositions and geometries, establishing a proof-of-concept for high-precision, end-to-end simulations. Our simulations employ angular-dependent muon energy distributions, which improve secondary flux accuracy. For the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I research spaces, we predict total muon-induced neutron fluxes of $(3.78 \\pm 0.61_{\\text{sys}}) \\times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(3.97 \\pm 0.65_{\\text{sys}}) \\times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively, consistent with empirical depth parameterizations. The simulated neutron energy spectra exhibit the expected thermal, epithermal, evaporation, and spallation components extending to GeV energies. Electromagnetic backgrounds are expected to dominate the total flux, with $\\gamma$-ray components of $(5.54 \\pm 0.91_{\\text{sys}}) \\times 10^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(6.51 \\pm 1.06_{\\text{sys}}) \\times 10^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I facilities, respectively. These results provide quantitative background predictions for experimental design and sensitivity projections at shallow- and deep-underground facilities. They further demonstrate that local geology and overburden geometry influence muon-induced secondary yields and energy spectra, emphasizing the need for site-specific simulations for accurate underground background characterization. Therefore, the simulation framework has been made publicly available for the broader low-background physics community to enable meaningful inter-facility comparisons.",

    "title": "PhysDNet: Physics-Guided Decomposition Network of Side-Scan Sonar   Imagery",
    "abstract": "Side-scan sonar (SSS) has become an essential tool for seafloor mapping and underwater exploration. However, the measured intensity is entangled with seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss, making the imagery highly view dependent and hindering robust interpretation. To address this challenge, we propose PhysDNet, a physics-guided multi-branch network that explicitly decouples SSS images into three interpretable fields: reflectivity, elevation, and path loss. The network employs attention augmented encoder decoder branches, imposes range wise consistency constraints on path loss, and incorporates a Lambertian based reconstruction to enable progressive selfsupervised training, thereby ensuring stable multi-task optimization while embedding physical priors into the learning process. Experiments demonstrate that the decomposed fields preserve geological structures, recover physically consistent illumination and attenuation, and enable accurate shadow prediction. These findings confirm that physics guided decomposition establishes a stable and interpretable domain for SSS analysis, enhancing both physical consistency and downstream applications such as registration and shadow interpretation.",

    "title": "Kinetic collisionless model of the solar transition region and corona   with spatially intermittent heating",
    "abstract": "We develop a three-dimensional kinetic model of the solar transition region and corona in which the plasma above the chromosphere is collisionless and embedded in a uniform magnetic field. Heating occurs intermittently at discrete locations on the chromospheric surface, modeled through a surface coarse-graining procedure that produces non-thermal boundary conditions for the Vlasov equation. The resulting stationary distribution functions generate suprathermal particle populations and naturally lead to a temperature inversion via gravitational filtering, without any local coronal heating. The model reproduces realistic temperature and density profiles with a thin transition region and a hot corona, consistent with solar observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial intermittency of heating at the chromospheric interface is sufficient to account for the formation of the transition region and the high-temperature corona.",

As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.",

    "title": "Advances in Radiative Capture Studies at LUNA with a Segmented BGO   Detector",
    "abstract": "Studies of charged-particle reactions for low-energy nuclear astrophysics require high sensitivity, which can be achieved by means of detection setups with high efficiency and low backgrounds, to obtain precise measurements in the energy region of interest for stellar scenarios. High-efficiency total absorption spectroscopy is an established and powerful tool for studying radiative capture reactions, particularly if combined with the cosmic background reduction by several orders of magnitude obtained at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). We present recent improvements in the detection setup with the Bismuth Germanium Oxide (BGO) detector at LUNA, aiming to reduce high-energy backgrounds and to increase the summing detection efficiency. The new design results in enhanced sensitivity of the BGO setup, as we demonstrate and discuss in the context of the first direct measurement of the 65 keV resonance ($E_{x} = 5672$ keV) of the $^{17}$O($p,\\gamma$)$^{18}$F reaction. Moreover, we show two applications of the BGO detector, which exploit its segmentation. In case of complex $\\gamma$-ray cascades, e.g. the de-excitation of $E_{x} = 5672$ keV in $^{18}$F, the BGO segmentation allows to identify and suppress the beam-induced background signals that mimic the sum peak of interest. We demonstrate another new application for such a detector in form of in-situ activation measurements of a reaction with $\\beta ^{+}$ unstable product nuclei, e.g., the $^{14}$N($p,\\gamma$)$^{15}$O reaction.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the nonlinear evolution of the lower hybrid drift instability (LHDI) in reconnecting current sheets using a hybrid kinetic simulation model implemented in the Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code. The model treats ions kinetically and electrons with a drift-kinetic approximation, solving self-consistent coupled electrostatic and electromagnetic fields. A parametric study explores the effects of mass ratio, temperature ratio, plasma beta, and sheet thickness. In electrostatic cases, LHDI remains localized at the sheet edges, flattening density gradients. In electromagnetic regimes, turbulence induced by LHDI generates magnetic perturbations that kink the current sheet and enhance anomalous resistivity. These dynamics may facilitate fast magnetic reconnection under certain conditions. Our results bridge prior theoretical predictions and simulations, emphasizing the importance of kinetic instabilities in reconnection physics.",

    "title": "Exploring Complexity Measures for Analysis of Solar Wind Structures and   Streams",
    "abstract": "In this paper we use statistical complexity and information theory metrics to study structure within solar wind time series. We explore this using entropy-complexity and information planes, where the measure for entropy is formed using either permutation entropy or the degree distribution of a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The entropy is then compared to the Jensen complexity (Jensen-Shannon complexity plane) and Fisher information measure (Fisher-Shannon information plane), formed both from permutations and the HVG approach. Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel application of the Timepix3 optical camera (Tpx3Cam) for investigating ultrafast dynamics in substrate-free nanoparticles at the Extreme Light Infrastructure European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ELI ERIC). The camera, integrated into an ion imaging system based on a micro-channel plate (MCP) and a fast P47 scintillator, enables individual time-stamping of incoming ions with nanosecond timing precision and high spatial resolution. The detector successfully captured laser-induced ion events originating from free nanoparticles disintegrated by intense laser pulses. Owing to the broad size distribution of the nanoparticles (10-500 nm) and the variation in laser intensities within the interaction volume, the detected events range in occupancy from near-zero to extremely high, approaching the readout limits of the detector. By combining time-of-flight and velocity map imaging (VMI) techniques, detailed post-processing and analysis were performed. The results presented here focus on the performance of Tpx3Cam under high-occupancy conditions, which are of particular relevance to this study. These conditions approach the limitations imposed by the camera readout capabilities and challenge the effectiveness of standard post-processing algorithms. We investigated these limitations and associated trade-offs, and we present improved methods and algorithms designed to extract the most informative features from the data.",

    "title": "Short-Pulse High-Power THz Generation Using Optical Klystron FELs:   Simulation Results",
    "abstract": "We investigate the feasibility of extending the optical klystron (OK) concept into the terahertz (THz) regime, where strong radiation slippage and diffraction fundamentally challenge efficient free- electron laser (FEL) operation. Numerical simulations were carried out for resonant wavelengths of 10, 30, and 100 {\\mu}m using parameters relevant to the planned DALI facility. The results show that while long wavelengths exhibit rapid energy growth, they suffer from significant temporal broadening due to slippage, whereas shorter wavelengths require large dispersive strengths R56 to achieve sufficient bunching. Harmonic bunching is demonstrated as a viable alternative to reduce the required R56 at short wavelengths. Diffraction was analyzed and found not to limit the present design, as the radiation spot size remains well within the beamline aperture. To address the slippage challenge, we propose and numerically demonstrate a novel chicane-embedded optical delay scheme, which restores phase alignment between the radiation and microbunched electrons. Simulations confirm that careful tuning of the dispersive strengths allows staged amplification, preserving beam quality and reaching multi-megawatt output power. These results highlight the potential of THz- tailored optical klystrons to generate compact, short, and high-intensity THz pulses, and lay the groundwork for future experimental studies and facility implementation.",

    "title": "SPARTA: Python-Based Automated Spectral Parameter Analysis and   Assessment System for Resonance Tracking",
    "abstract": "Accurately determining resonance frequencies and quality factors (Q) is crucial in accelerator physics and radiofrequency engineering, as these factors have direct impacts on system design, operational stability, and research results. The methods currently employed to facilitate resonance analysis are mostly manual, requiring operators and physicists to estimate resonant parameters and examine scattering parameter (S-parameter) data from vector network analyzers (VNAs). The current techniques therefore become laborious, operator-dependent and challenging to replicate when applied to large datasets or across multiple analyses. Despite the importance of these tasks for high-volume research organizations such as CERN where S-parameter measurements are regularly taken for cavity and beam diagnostic research, the currently widespread measures are outdated.   In order to automate the laborious resonance characterization process, this paper presents SPARTA (Spectral Parameter Analysis for Resonance Tracking and Assessment), a data analysis software framework based on Python. SPARTA has integrated data ingestion, preprocessing, resonance detection, quality factor estimation, visualization and persistent cloud storage into a reproducible and scalable workflow. SPARTA was developed with the scientific libraries NumPy, SciPy and scikit-rf for accurate and efficient numerical processing, Flask and Dash for interactive and lightweight visualization, and SQLite for easy database management. The three main contributions of this work are outlined as follows: Firstly, this paper presents a methodological framework for resonance detection and assessment based on established RF theory. The second section describes the system architecture and implementation of SPARTA, highlighting data handling, computation and visualization. Finally this paper discusses the results and advantages of automated analysis.",

    "title": "Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory   Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties",
    "abstract": "X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "We present a new theory describing the variation of electron capture and bound-state $\\beta$-decays in atomic ions and (non) local thermodynamic equilibrium ((N)LTE) plasmas. We adopt the Takahashi-Yokoi nuclear model with added corrections to first calculate the decay rate for each atomic configuration of the isotope, and then evaluate the in-plasma decay rate by combining them with the charge state distribution (CSD) consistent with plasma density and temperature. Our approach expands the thermodynamic parameter space in which in-plasma $\\beta$-decays can be studied, opening the possibility to validate the model in low-density laboratory magnetoplasmas before application to stellar nucleosynthesis. The model is explained using $^{7}$Be, and then applied to higher mass isotopes such as $^{140}$Pr$^{0+,57+,58+}$, $^{142}$Pm$^{0+,59+,60+}$ and $^{163}$Dy$^{66+}$. Our model is therefore amenable to isotopes in a wide range of masses, in both single charge state or in a plasma-generated CSD.",

    "title": "Deposition rate and energy to substrate in chopped and standard HiPIMS:   identifying optimal pulse parameters",
    "abstract": "High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) offers higher ionized flux fractions at the cost of lower deposition rates compared to conventional DCMS. A fine optimization of the deposition conditions is crucial for specific applications. Chopped or multi-pulse HiPIMS (segmenting pulses into shorter micropulses) has been proposed to mitigate ion back-attraction and promote working gas recovery. This study investigates how micropulse length, delay time between segments, and magnetic field strength influence energy flux, deposition rate, and ionized flux fraction in chopped and standard HiPIMS. These quantities are evaluated by passive thermal probe, biasable QCM and mass spectrometer measurements at the substrate position. Deposition-averaged and pulse-averaged power is kept constant for all conditions to facilitate meaningful comparison. Results indicate that chopping the HiPIMS pulse consistently leads to higher energy flux and total deposition rate compared to standard HiPIMS at the same total pulse length, primarily due to increased ion flux. A weaker unbalanced magnetic field configuration enhances deposition rates and ion transport. In chopped HiPIMS, increasing micropulse length decreased energy flux and deposition rates, whereas increasing the delay time between micropulses substantially improved these parameters. Importantly, standard HiPIMS, which operated at higher frequencies and short pulse lengths, demonstrated superior performance (with higher total energy and particle fluxes) than chopped HiPIMS when compared at similar short pulse durations. This suggests that consistent short pulse durations and sufficient off-times for complete gas refill are paramount for maximizing ion fluxes and deposition rates.",
