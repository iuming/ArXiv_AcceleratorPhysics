  "title": "Beam Energy Measurement using a Bayesian Approach with the Stacked Foil   Method",
  "abstract": "We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the inferred beam energy.",
