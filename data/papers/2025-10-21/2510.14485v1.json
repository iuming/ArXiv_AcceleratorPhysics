  "title": "Coherent radiation produced by microtron electron bunches",
  "abstract": "The theory of coherent transition radiation produced by a relativistic electron beam during its extraction from a microtron is established. Expressions for the beam form factor, spectral-angular and angular distribution of coherent transition radiation are obtained in explicit form. Estimates of microwave noise caused by coherent transition radiation are given.",
