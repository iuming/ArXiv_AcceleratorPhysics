  "title": "Compensating for Amplifier Non-Linearity in a SEL Controller",
  "abstract": "The Self-Excited Loop (SEL) architecture, used in some continuous-wave (CW) superconducting linacs, relies on a positive feedback mechanism that requires carefully defined operating limits to ensure stable operation. These limits are typically derived from amplifier calibration, which characterizes the relationship between forward power and DAC drive. However, amplifier non-linearity often prevents a simple linear fit of this characteristic, introducing errors that can compromise stability. To address this, we present a modified calibration procedure that incorporates amplifier non-linearity into the SEL framework. The approach is validated with test data from a 32 kW solid-state amplifier (SSA) and a cavity emulator developed for the Fermilab PIP-II linac.",
