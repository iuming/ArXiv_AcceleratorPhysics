  "title": "3D-Structured Polyethylene Windows for Low-Loss Transmission in Wideband   Cryogenic Terahertz Systems",
  "abstract": "We present the design, fabrication, and characterisation of a broadband vacuum window and infrared filter based on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) for millimeter wave receivers operating across ALMA Band 6 and 7 (211-373 GHz). The window incorporates pyramidal anti-reflection (AR) structures, machined directly into the polyethylene using CNC machining, which provide impedance matching over a broad frequency range. The structured UHMWPE method was implemented in two distinct components: a vacuum window and a cryogenic infrared filter. This surface structuring approach provides mechanical robustness, cryogenic compatibility, and low insertion loss. We characterize the transmission properties using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS), which demonstrates reflection below $5\\%$ across the full band. Complementary heterodyne measurements confirm improved receiver noise performance. These results establish 3D structured UHMWPE as a promising platform for broadband cryogenic optics in high-sensitivity THz instrumentation.",
