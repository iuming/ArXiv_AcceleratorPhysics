  "title": "Comparative Simulation of CEvNS Recoil Observables in Geant4 Using   Germanium, Argon, and Xenon Targets",
  "abstract": "We present a Geant4-based simulation study of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) for three commonly used detector targets: Germanium, Argon, and Xenon. A custom CEvNS model was implemented, including differential cross sections and Helm form factors. Recoil energy spectra, angular distributions, and form factor effects were analyzed using ROOT. The results reveal expected trends: heavier nuclei lead to lower recoil energies and increased form factor suppression. This work provides a simulation framework to support future theoretical and experimental studies in neutrino physics and dark matter searches.",
