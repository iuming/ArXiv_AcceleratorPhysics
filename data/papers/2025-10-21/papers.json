    "title": "Low-impedance stripline kicker for the transverse instability   suppression system of the synchrotron radiation facility \"SKIF\" light source",
    "abstract": "Construction of the new fourth generation synchrotron radiation facility (SRF) \"SKIF\" near Novosibirsk is nearing completion. \"SKIF\" uniqueness is ultra-low 75 pm natural emittance at 400 mA beam current and 3 GeV beam energy.   Collective effects (beam interaction with the vacuum chamber) are the main obstacles of achieving such emittance and beam current. To suppress these effects the storage ring will be equipped with a bunch-by-bunch feedback system. Important components of the feedback system are a stripline (fast) kicker and a beam position monitor.   The paper describes design of the low-impedance stripline kicker for SRF \"SKIF\" storage ring, optimized for the manufacturing and for the uniformity of the imparted transverse kick. The kicker qualities such as S-parameters, imparted transverse momentum, transfer and beam impedances are presented. The chosen length of the stripline kicker allows its use as a beam position monitor.",

    "title": "Mimetic finite difference schemes for transport operators with   divergence-free advective field and applications to plasma physics",
    "abstract": "In wave propagation problems, finite difference methods implemented on staggered grids are commonly used to avoid checkerboard patterns and to improve accuracy in the approximation of short-wavelength components of the solutions. In this study, we develop a mimetic finite difference (MFD) method on staggered grids for transport operators with divergence-free advective field that is proven to be energy-preserving in wave problems. This method mimics some characteristics of the summation-by-parts (SBP) operators framework, in particular it preserves the divergence theorem at the discrete level. Its design is intended to be versatile and applicable to wave problems characterized by a divergence-free velocity. As an application, we consider the electrostatic shear Alfv\\'en waves (SAWs), appearing in the modeling of plasmas. These waves are solved in a magnetic field configuration recalling that of a tokamak device. The study of the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the SAWs shows the energy conservation of the discretization scheme, demonstrating the stability of the numerical solution.",

    "title": "Compensating for Amplifier Non-Linearity in a SEL Controller",
    "abstract": "The Self-Excited Loop (SEL) architecture, used in some continuous-wave (CW) superconducting linacs, relies on a positive feedback mechanism that requires carefully defined operating limits to ensure stable operation. These limits are typically derived from amplifier calibration, which characterizes the relationship between forward power and DAC drive. However, amplifier non-linearity often prevents a simple linear fit of this characteristic, introducing errors that can compromise stability. To address this, we present a modified calibration procedure that incorporates amplifier non-linearity into the SEL framework. The approach is validated with test data from a 32 kW solid-state amplifier (SSA) and a cavity emulator developed for the Fermilab PIP-II linac.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory plasma production almost always preferentially heats either the ions or electrons, leading to a two-temperature state. High-fidelity modeling of these systems can be achieved with density functional theory molecular dynamics in the two-temperature, adiabatic electron limit. Motivated by this, we construct a statistical mechanics framework for the multi-temperature system that is theoretically consistent with the ab initio calculation. We proceed to derive multi-temperature quantum Ornstein-Zernike equations for the first time. We then construct a two-temperature two-component plasma model using the average atom and compute the radial distribution function, viscosity, ion thermal conductivity, and ion self-diffusion. We verify that we recover the ionic structure and self-diffusion of density functional molecular dynamics simulations.",

    "title": "Three-dimensional unmagnetized Mach probe analysis and initial flow   measurements in reversed-field pinch experiments",
    "abstract": "A novel matrix method of analyzing ion saturation current data from a general three-dimensional (3D) array of unmagnetized Mach probe tips is developed and used with data sets from two 3D Mach probes to make initial measurements of local plasma flow velocity in reversed-field pinch (RFP) experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST). The two 3D Mach probes are composed of regular polyhedral arrays of six and four tips, respectively, with the six-tip array composed of three orthogonal pairs of mutually opposite tips at the vertices of a regular octahedron and the four-tip array composed of non-opposite tips at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, the analysis of which is specifically facilitated by the matrix method. Velocity measurement uncertainties for the Mach probes are derived based on uncertainties in probe machining and ion saturation current measurements, and typical relative uncertainties for the probes are estimated to be of order several percent, likely smaller than systematic uncertainties related to the Mach probe calibration constant and experimental uncertainties related to plasma and probe conditioning. Initial results for the octahedral probe show flow speeds of roughly the expected magnitudes based on previous MST measurements but with somes differences in flow direction, while those for the tetrahedron probe show similar flow directions to some previous measurements but also some larger than expected speeds. We consider possible causes for the unexpected results of these initial tests, with a focus on probe conditioning and fast electron issues.",

    "abstract": "We present the design, fabrication, and characterisation of a broadband vacuum window and infrared filter based on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) for millimeter wave receivers operating across ALMA Band 6 and 7 (211-373 GHz). The window incorporates pyramidal anti-reflection (AR) structures, machined directly into the polyethylene using CNC machining, which provide impedance matching over a broad frequency range. The structured UHMWPE method was implemented in two distinct components: a vacuum window and a cryogenic infrared filter. This surface structuring approach provides mechanical robustness, cryogenic compatibility, and low insertion loss. We characterize the transmission properties using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS), which demonstrates reflection below $5\\%$ across the full band. Complementary heterodyne measurements confirm improved receiver noise performance. These results establish 3D structured UHMWPE as a promising platform for broadband cryogenic optics in high-sensitivity THz instrumentation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which, however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ with static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures. In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within the framework of DFT for a host of applications.",

After the successful achievement of its first MA-class plasma, the installation of several additional sub-systems, including a set of non-axisymmetric Error Field Correction Coils (EFCC), is ongoing. Optimization of future JT-60SA plasma scenarios will critically depend on the correct use of EFCC, including careful fulfillment of system specifications. In addition to that, preparation and risk mitigation of early ITER operations will greatly benefit from the experience gained by early EFCC application to JT-60SA experiments, in particular to optimize error field detection and control strategies. In this work, EFCC application in JT-60SA Initial Research Phase I perspective scenarios is modeled including plasma response. Impact of (Resonant) Magnetic Perturbations on the different plasma scenarios is assessed for both core and pedestal regions by the linear resistive MHD code MARS-F. The dominant core response to EFs is discussed case by case and compared to mode locking thresholds from literature. Typical current/voltage amplitudes and wave-forms are then compared to EFCC specifications in order to assess a safe operational space.",

While two VUV-sensitive SiPMs are available, comprehensive in-situ studies are needed to inform detector design and compare device response. This work presents a direct comparison of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) VUV-HD3 and Hamamatsu (HPK) VUV4 SiPMs operated simultaneously within the Light-only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) detector. Using data collected with gamma sources placed outside the detector, we characterized the relative performance of these photosensors. Our analysis reveals that under these operating conditions, the HPK SiPMs are 33-38% less efficient than the FBK devices, a larger difference than predicted by standard PDE models in vacuum measurement. We show that this discrepancy is resolved by our angular and wavelength dependent PDE model incorporating surface shadowing effects into our optical simulation, which then accurately reproduces the experimental data. This finding has significant implications for the selection and implementation of photosensors in future large-scale LXe detectors.",

    "abstract": "Precession of a converged beam during acquisition of a 4D-STEM dataset improves strain, orientation, and phase mapping accuracy by averaging over continuous angles of illumination. Precession experiments usually rely on integrated systems, where automatic alignments lead to fast, high-quality results. The dependence of these experiments on specific hardware and software is evident even when switching to non-integrated detectors on a precession tool, as experimental set-up becomes challenging and time-consuming. Here, we introduce multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a method to perform electron diffraction by collecting sequential 4D-STEM scans at different incident beam tilts. The multiple diffraction datasets are averaged together post-acquisition, resulting in a single dataset that minimizes the impact of the curvature and orientation of the Ewald sphere relative to the crystal under study. Our results demonstrate that even four additional tilts improved measurement of material properties, namely strain and orientation, as compared to single-tilt 4D-STEM experiments. We show the versatility and flexibility of our MAPED approach with data collected on a number of microscopes with different hardware configurations and a variety of detectors.",

    "title": "A low-cost, open-source maskless photolithography stepper for   microfabrication",
    "abstract": "Photolithography is a key part of modern semiconductor process flows, and photolithography steppers have been used for decades to achieve precise patterning for device fabrication. However, these tools are often large and expensive, which restricts their use to industry and well-funded university laboratories. In this paper, we propose a $3000 maskless photolithography stepper that is affordable, open-source, and easy to assemble. The stepper, which uses a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector as its optical engine, is able to achieve an optical resolution of under 2 microns. The stepper also features a motorized micropositioning system, which is able to align features with single-digit micron precision. A deep learning computer vision model is also used to achieve fine-grain alignment of patterns on a chip. These capabilities allow for the use of the stepper for microfabrication to produce micron-scale devices such as NMOS transistors.",

    "title": "Graph-based Neural Space Weather Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.",

    "abstract": "In 1978, Delayen showed how Self-Excited Loops (SEL) can be used to great advantage for controlling narrow-band SRF cavities. Its key capability is establishing closed-loop amplitude control early in the setup process, stabilizing Lorentz forces to allow cavity tuning and phase loop setup in a stable environment. As people around the world implement this basic idea with modern FPGA DSP technology, multiple variations and operational scenarios creep in that have both obvious and non-obvious ramifications for latency, feedback stability, and resiliency. This paper will review the key properties of a Delayen-style SEL when set up for open-loop, amplitude stabilized, and phase-stabilized modes. Then the original analog circuit will be compared and contrasted with the known variations of digital CORDIC-based implementations.",

    "title": "Design optimization of silicon nitride nanomechanical resonators for   thermal infrared detectors: a guide through key figures of merit",
    "abstract": "Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling. Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use cases.",

    "abstract": "A new comprehensive study on the Cs${_2}$ZrCl${_6}$ (CZC) crystal scintillating properties under different types of irradiation was performed over a wide temperature range from 5 to 300 K. The light yield (LY) at room temperature (RT), measured under irradiation by 662 keV $\\gamma$ quanta of $^{137}$Cs, was evaluated to be 53,300 $\\pm$ 4,700 photons/MeV corresponding to approximately 71% of its estimated absolute value. The maximum light emission was observed in the temperature interval 135-165 K, where the LY reached 56,900 photons/MeV and 19,700 photons/MeV for $\\gamma$ quanta and $\\alpha$ particles, respectively. The quenching factor (QF) for $\\alpha$ particles increases smoothly from QF = 0.30 at RT to QF = 0.36 at 135 K. The shape of scintillation pulses induced by $\\alpha$ particles is characterized by three time-constants (0.3, 2.5 and 11.8 $\\mu$s at RT), whereas the average pulse of $\\gamma$ induced events is characterized by two time-constants (1.3 and 11.5 $\\mu$s at RT). At the same time, scintillating properties and pulse-shape discrimination capability of the CZC exhibit an acute deterioration at temperatures below 135 K. The optimal operating conditions to maximize the scintillating performance of undoped CZC crystals are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Magneto-acoustic waves in partially ionized plasmas are damped due to elastic collisions between charged and neutral particles. Here, we use a linearized two-fluid model to describe the influence of this collisional interaction on the properties of small-amplitude waves propagating in a uniform and static background. Mainly focusing on the case of waves generated by a periodic driver, we perform a detailed study of the dependence of the wavenumbers and damping rates on the ionization degree of the plasma, the strength of the collisional coupling, and the angle of propagation. We describe how the different wave modes (fast, slow, acoustic) are related to the individual properties of each fluid in a wide range of physical conditions. In addition, we derive analytical approximations for the damping rates due to charge-neutral collisions in the limits of weak and strong coupling and check their range of validity in comparison with the exact numerical results. These approximations can be generally applied to a large variety of astrophysical and laboratory partially ionized plasmas, but here we also discuss the particular application to plasmas only composed of hydrogen.",

    "title": "Influence of kinetic effects in large-scale magnetic reconnection with   multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY",
    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a multiscale phenomenon where fluid- and particle-scale processes interact. The particle-in-cell (PIC) method, capable of resolving kinetic (particle-scale) physics, is extensively used to study the kinetic effects in magnetic reconnection. Meanwhile, because of the high computational cost, PIC simulations cannot capture the interaction between kinetic and fluid dynamics, which poses a major obstacle to understanding magnetic reconnection in large-scale phenomena such as solar flares. A multi-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC provides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps. We developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And Magnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD simulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are solved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we conducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem. The results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated in the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale structures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability of our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the KAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find that the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the PIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the spatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \\sim 100 \\lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.",

This paper presents a further study on the high-precision optics, namely slice optics, of the Booster Ring (BRing) at HIAF based on measured magnetic fields, focusing on two aspects: closed-orbit distortion and optical parameter variations caused by errors, and dynamic aperture. A detailed study is conducted on the closed-orbit distortion and changes in optical parameters caused by magnet alignment errors and dipole magnet field errors. Meanwhile, A detailed study is also conducted on the dynamic aperture of BRing. The results show that the sliced optics and the original optics are comparable in terms of the impact of these errors on the closed-orbit and optical parameters. Without chromaticity correction, the dynamic aperture of the sliced optics is superior to that of the original optics; after chromaticity correction, the sliced optics is also comparable to the original optics. This study provides valuable insights for accelerator tuning and optimization.",

    "title": "Beam Energy Measurement using a Bayesian Approach with the Stacked Foil   Method",
    "abstract": "We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the inferred beam energy.",

    "title": "Evaluating plastic scintillator performance as a substitute of LYSO in   SiPM based animal PET scanners: A GEANT4 simulation analysis",
    "abstract": "A systematic study is conducted to understand the coincident resolving time (CRT) for a pair of Lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) and the plastic scintillation detector bars under the Geant4 framework. Crystals are coupled to a silicon photomultiplier single pad wafer with an appropriate optical coupling for signal readout. Pad reads the light photons undergoing optoelectronic conversion at the wafer site and generates electrical pulses with a bi-exponential shape. These signals are used to determine the trigger time stamp of back-to-back gamma-rays emitted from a point source, enabling the evaluation of CRT performance at different plastic scintillator lengths. For the LYSO detector, the simulation yields the CRT response of 174 ps, which aligns to the literature reported value for the dimensions 2 mm x 2 mm x 10 mm. To identify the plastic scintillator dimensions with an integrated gamma-ray detection efficiency comparable to LYSO's photopeak efficiency at 511 keV gamma photons, various bar lengths of commercial plastic BC404 and TIFR Ooty's in-house developed plastic material are attempted in Geant4. Consequently, for both the plastic scintillators, the equivalent length (for the same cross-sectional area) was found to be 4 times that of LYSO crystal length at a threshold of 25 keV. CRT value determined for this dimension is found to be $\\approx$ 300 ps for both the plastic medium. It suggests that, if an animal preclinical PET scanner is developed with plastic bars, the minimum achievable image resolution (FWHM) of $\\approx$ 4.5 cm can be expected for a pair of detection elements.",

    "title": "Nanodiamond photocathodes for MPGD-based single photon detectors",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the suitability of Hydrogenated NanoDiamond (HND) materials as an alternative for CsI in MPGD-based photon detectors. The research focuses on characterizing HND photocathodes coupled with THGEM + Micromegas-based detectors. The HND grains were prepared via hydrogenation and stored in water for more than two years. They were then coated on PCB discs or THGEMs using a pulsed spray technique. The resulting quantum efficiency (QE) values (~4% at 122 nm) were found to be within a factor of 10 of the best freshly hydrogenated samples reported in the literature ( ~40% at 120 nm). The robustness of reflective HND photocathodes against ion bombardment was measured to be about 10 times larger than the corresponding CsI one after the same charge accumulation. Furthermore, THGEM characterization indicates minimal alteration in response after HND coatings. These results suggest that HND holds potential as a more robust photocathode for gaseous detectors, offering improved performance in single-photon detection applications.",

    "abstract": "A robust and infrared laser-excited photocathode with high quantum efficiency, high brightness, and low cost, operating under a moderate vacuum, has long been sought by the accelerator and microscopy communities. This study investigates various types of graphite photocathodes, including bulk, sheet, and flake graphite, in the regime of thermionically assisted photoemission by an irradiating infrared laser. Our experiment reveals that, under space-charge-limited photoemission, the flake-graphite photocathode with a dense population of nano-graphene fins on its surface exhibits the highest quantum efficiency, which is 770 times greater than that of a copper photocathode irradiated by the same infrared laser at 1064 nm. With our theory considering both thermionic and multiphoton emissions, we determine that the flake graphite photocathode is 200 times brighter than a copper photocathode irradiated by an infrared laser and is as bright as a LaB6 field emitter.",

    "abstract": "The construction of the first phase of the High energy FRagment Separator (HFRS Phase-I) has already been completed and it is anticipated to start beam commissioning in autumn 2025. This paper presents the first order and higher order beam optics calculations for the HFRS Phase-I, using measured magnet data, and evaluates its experimental performance in preparation for beam commissioning. The first order optics of HFRS is calculated based on the sliced magnetic fields and the higher order aberrations are corrected using a self-compiled program. Monte Carlo particle tracking is employed to analyze the beam phase spaces on the focal planes. The experimental performance of the machine is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. The beam phase spaces on the focal planes are thoroughly examined, demonstrating that the higher order aberrations have been well corrected. Moreover, the experimental performance of HFRS is evaluated based on the corrected higher order optics, yielding satisfactory results: the secondary beams of interest can be well separated and exhibit high transmission efficiency. This work provides valuable insights for the upcoming beam commissioning of HFRS Phase-I. The effective correction of higher order aberrations and optimized magnet settings lay a solid foundation for future experiments.",

    "abstract": "We study the characteristics of small-amplitude nonlinear dust-ion-acoustic (DIA) solitary waves in active magnetized positive-ion-beam-driven dusty plasmas with the effects of nonadiabatic and adiabatic dust charge variations. In the model, we consider the ion-neutral collision and thereby consider the collision enhanced ion current to the dust-charging process and dust charge fluctuations. We show that the streaming of the positive-ion beam significantly affects the dust-charging process in which the dust charge number decreases (increases) with an increased beam velocity (number density). Using the standard reductive perturbation technique, we derive the evolution equations in the form of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations for DIA solitary waves for two different cases: nonadiabatic and adiabatic dust charge variations. We study the effect of positive ion beam, dust charge variation, magnetic field, ion creation, and ion-neutral collision enhanced current on the wave characteristics. We find that the soliton energy decays with time and is affected by the beam velocity. Also, the solitary waves get damped by the effects of ion creation, ion loss, ion-neutral collision enhanced current, and dust charge variation. Although the ion beam does not change the polarity of solitary waves in the case of adiabatic dust charge variation, a transition from rarefactive to compressive solitary waves occurs in the presence of an ion beam with nonadiabatic dust charge variation.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses transport barrier formation and layering as consequences of jam formation. Extensive use is made of analogies with the theory of traffic flow in one dimension. The relation of flux jamming to motility induced phase separation (MIPS) is explained. Two routes to heat flux jamming are identified. The first is due to a rollover in the heat flux-pulse size relation, i.e. $dQ_T(\\delta T)/d\\delta T<0$, and is similar to the condition of flux-gradient bistability. The second occurs when the delay time between pulse and heat flux exceeds a critical value. This does not require bistability and tends to occur near marginality. This analysis yields an estimate of the answer to the eternal question of 'how near is \"near\"?'. Staircase development is shown to follow jamiton train formation. The relation of jamming of avalanches to phase transitions in drift wave-zonal flow turbulence is elucidated. The formation of outward propagating blob trains and inward propagating void trains is demonstrated. The important role of turbulence spreading is identified.",

    "title": "Kinetic Scale Energy Budget in Turbulent Plasmas: Role of Electron to   Ion Temperature Ratio",
    "abstract": "The dissipation mechanisms in weakly collisional plasmas have been a longstanding topic of investigation, where significant progress has been made in recent years. A recent promising development is the use of the \"scale-filtered\" Vlasov-Maxwell equations to fully quantify the scale-by-scale energy balance, a feature that was absent when using fluid models in kinetic plasmas. In particular, this method reveals that the energy transfer in kinetic scales is fully accounted for by the scale-filtered pressure-strain interaction. Despite this progress, the influence of ion-electron thermal disequilibrium on the kinetic-scale energy budget remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of decaying plasma turbulence, we systematically investigate the pressure-strain interaction and its components at sub-ion scales by varying electron-to-ion temperature ratios. Our analysis focuses on three key ingredients of the pressure-strain interaction: the normal and shear components of Pi-D and pressure dilatation. Our results demonstrate that the scale-filtered pressure-strain interaction is dominated by scale-filtered Pi-D across the kinetic range, with the shear component consistently providing the dominant contribution. We find that the scale-filtered normal and shear contributions of Pi-D exhibit persistent anticorrelation and opposite signs across all kinetic scales. We also discover that the amplitude of both anisotropic components for each species scales directly with their temperature and inversely with the temperature of the other species, while the scale-filtered pressure dilatation remains negligible compared to the Pi-D terms but shows enhanced compressibility effects as plasma temperatures decrease. We discuss the implications of these findings in thermally non-equilibrated plasmas, such as in the turbulent magnetosheath and solar wind.",

    "abstract": "Flying focus techniques produce laser pulses whose focal points travel at arbitrary, controllable velocities. While this flexibility can enhance a broad range of laser-based applications, existing techniques constrain the motion of the focal point to the propagation direction of the pulse. Here, we introduce a flying focus configuration that decouples the motion of the focus from the propagation direction. A chirped laser pulse focused and diffracted by a diffractive lens and grating creates a focal point that can move both along and transverse to the propagation direction. The focal length of the lens, grating period, and chirp can be tuned to control the direction and velocity of the focus. Simulations demonstrate this control for a holographic configuration suited to high-power pulses, in which two off-axis pump beams with different focal lengths encode the equivalent phase of a chromatic lens and grating in a gas or plasma. For low-power pulses, conventional solid-state or adaptive optics can be used instead. Multi-dimensional control over the focal trajectory enables new configurations for applications, including laser wakefield acceleration of ions, steering of broadband THz radiation, and surface harmonic generation.",

    "abstract": "The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\\geq 90^\\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.",

    "abstract": "We present a parsimonious and robust machine learning approach for identifying plasma confinement states in fusion power plants (FPPs) where reliable identification of the low-confinement (L-mode) and high-confinement (H-mode) regimes is critical for safe and efficient operation. Unlike research-oriented devices, FPPs must operate with a severely constrained set of diagnostics. To address this challenge, we demonstrate that a minimalist model, using only electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals, can deliver accurate and reliable state classification. ECE provides electron temperature profiles without the engineering or survivability issues of in-vessel probes, making it a primary candidate for FPP-relevant diagnostics. Our framework employs ECE as input, extracts features with radial basis functions, and applies a gradient boosting classifier, achieving high accuracy with test accuracy averaging 96\\% correct predictions. Robustness analysis and feature importance study confirm the reliability of the approach. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art performance is attainable from a restricted diagnostic set, paving the way for minimalist yet resilient plasma control architectures for FPPs.",

The data is used to validate MHD simulations incorporating recent improvements in magnetic transport modeling; we achieve reasonable agreement only with models with re-localization of transport by magnetic fields.

    "title": "Towards polarization-enhanced PET: Study of random background in   polarization-correlated Compton events",
    "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality that utilizes positron-emitting isotopes, such as Ga-68 and F-18, for many diagnostic purposes. The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\\pm$90$^{\\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\\sim$200 MBq to $\\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements. We find that the signal-to-random background ratios (SBRs) obtained from the polarization-correlated events for Compton scattering angles $\\theta_{1,2}\\in[72^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}]$ and azimuthal angle difference $\\Delta\\phi=90^{\\circ}\\pm20^{\\circ}$ are consistently higher than those from single-pixel events, with the ratio of their SBR values of 1.23. The SBR of the selected events also increases with the polarimetric modulation factor $\\mu$, gaining $\\sim$50\\% in value during the experiment.",

Using beam parameters from the University of Hawai`i (UH) at M\\=anoa FEL facility, our study shows that at nominal bunch length, the FEL radiation exhibits superradiant scaling in saturation. We then explore how cavity desynchronization enhances this regime by mitigating the laser lethargy effect in oscillators and improving overlap between the electron bunch and the radiation pulse, with peak power increased by more than a factor of five. Finally, we simulate a short-bunch operational mode with bunch length comparable to the slippage length, which accelerates saturation and further amplifies the FEL power. These findings highlight that the UH M\\=anoa FEL oscillator has the potential to achieve superradiant emission at its nominal operating mode, and that short-bunch operation offers further enhancement while requiring additional optimization.",

    "title": "No cosmological constraints on dark photon dark matter from resonant   conversion: Impact of nonlinear plasma dynamics",
    "abstract": "We revisit and invalidate all dark photon dark matter constraints from resonant conversion of dark photons into photons (plasmons) in the early universe. These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial portion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the plasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates because of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts into $k \\simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma. Once the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma, nonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant. In particular, we show using dedicated Particle-in-Cell simulations that large-amplitude $k = 0$ Langmuir waves excite higher-k Langmuir and ion acoustic waves, producing strong spatial variations in density and plasma frequency. These inhomogeneities suppress further resonant conversion, limiting the deposited energy to about the thermal energy of the electrons at the time of conversion, orders of magnitude below observable cosmological thresholds. Consequently, the dark photon dark matter constraints are weaker by factors of $3000$ to $10^7$ across ten orders of magnitude in dark photon mass.",

    "title": "Bell Instability and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in AGN Ultrafast Outflow   Shocks",
    "abstract": "We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.",

    "title": "High brightness multi-MeV photon source driven by a petawatt-scale laser   wakefield accelerator",
    "abstract": "We present an experimental demonstration of a bright multi-MeV gamma source driven by a petawatt laser. The source generates on average $(1.2\\pm0.6)\\times10^9$ photons above 1 MeV per pulse, exceeding those of previous all-optical sources by a hundred times, and reached a peak spectral brightness of $(3.9 \\pm 1.5)\\times 10^{22}$ photons/mm$^2$/mrad$^2$/s/0.1%BW at $\\epsilon_\\gamma\\approx11$ MeV. The source was produced by inverse Compton scattering of a laser wakefield accelerated GeV electron beam and its back-reflected driving laser pulse. Its performance is well described by a simple model of the laser and electron properties at the collision point that allows quantitative predictions and identifies clear strategies to further enhance radiation efficiency. Our results highlight the promise of this source for fundamental physics studies, as well as for applications of nuclear resonance fluorescence and nuclear transmutation.",

    "title": "Experimental evidence of production of directional muons from a   laser-wakefield accelerator",
    "abstract": "We report on experimental evidence of the generation of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator driven by a PW-class laser. The muons were generated following the interaction of a GeV-scale high-charge electron beam with a 2cm-thick Pb target and were detected using a Timepix3 detector placed behind a suitable shielding configuration. Data analysis indicates a $(99.1\\pm0.5)$% confidence of muon detection over noise, in excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Extrapolation of the experimental setup to higher electron energies and charges suggests the potential to guide and separate from noise approximately $10^4$ muons/s onto cm$^2$-scale areas for applications using a 10 Hz PW laser. These results demonstrate the possibility of generating and transporting directional muon beams using high-power lasers and establish a foundation for the systematic application of laser-driven high-energy muon beams.",

    "abstract": "Smartphones sensors are now commonly used by a worldwide audience thanks to their availability, high connectivity, and versatility. Here, we present a methodology to use a collection of smartphones, namely a fleet, as a distributed network of time-synchronized mechanical sensors. We first present the mechanical tests we develop to evaluate the smartphone sensor accuracy. We then describe how to use efficiently a distributed network of smartphones as autonomous sensors. We use a combination of an Android application hosted on each phone (Gobannos), and a server application (Phonefleet) on a controlling host to perform the tasks in parallel remotely. We detail the time synchronisation protocol we implemented, based on UDP communication. We achieved an accuracy of the time synchronisation of 60 microseconds, more than enough for all mechanical applications. Eventually, we present two test cases in which we use a smartphone fleet for mechanical wave measurements in field conditions.",

    "title": "Comparative Evaluation of Xilinx RFSoC Platform for Low-Level RF Systems",
    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Radio Frequency System-onChip (RFSoC) technology from Xilinx (AMD) has enabled the integration of high-speed data converters and programmable logic within a single package. RFSoC platforms are already widely adopted in telecommunications, radar, and satellite communications, where they promise reductions in system footprint and power consumption. However, their suitability for Low-Level RF (LLRF) control systems in accelerator environments - where stability requirements are critical - has not been quantitatively evaluated. This paper presents a comparative measurement-based assessment of RFSoC-based and conventional LLRF designs, focusing on signal fidelity, phase noise, latency, system complexity, and integration challenges. The advantages and challenges of adopting RFSoC-based direct conversion architectures are discussed, providing guidance for future LLRF system implementations.",
