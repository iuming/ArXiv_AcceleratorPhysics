  "title": "Nano-electronvolt Fourier-limited transition of a single   surface-adsorbed molecule",
  "abstract": "High-resolution spectroscopy allows one to probe weak interactions and to detect subtle phenomena. While such measurements are routinely performed on atoms and molecules in the gas phase, spectroscopy of adsorbed species on surfaces is faced with challenges. As a result, previous studies of surface-adsorbed molecules have fallen short of the ultimate resolution, where the transition linewidth is determined by the lifetime of the excited state. In this work, we conceive a new approach to surface deposition and report on Fourier-limited electronic transitions in single dibenzoterrylenes adsorbed onto the surface of an anthracene crystal. By performing spectroscopy and super-resolution microscopy at liquid helium temperature, we shed light on various properties of the adsorbed molecules. Our experimental results pave the way for a new class of experiments in surface science, where high spatial and spectral resolution can be combined.",
