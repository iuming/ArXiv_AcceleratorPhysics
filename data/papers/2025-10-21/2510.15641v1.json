  "title": "Formation of a Tungsten Co-deposition Layer with Microparticles Using   Pulsed Laser Deposition",
  "abstract": "This study performed tungsten (W) co-deposition experiments using pulsed laser deposition under exposure to helium/argon plasma in a linear plasma device. Micron-sized spherical W particles formed under co-deposition conditions. It was suggested that these particles grew from nanoparticles via the electrostatic collection of W ions in the plasma plume before deposition.",
