  "title": "Magnetohydrodynamic-guiding-center-particle-in-cell Method for   Multiscale Plasma Kinetic Simulations",
  "abstract": "We present the formulation, algorithm and numerical tests of the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method with particles treated under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of thermal (cold) fluid and high-energy particles whose dynamics are integrated through guiding center equations including drift motion, with carefully evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.",
