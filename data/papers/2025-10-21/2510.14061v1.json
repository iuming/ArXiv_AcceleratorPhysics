  "title": "Three-Dimensional Simulation of the University of Hawai`i FEL   Oscillator: Superradiant Emission and Cavity Desynchronization",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate superradiant emission in a free-electron laser (FEL) oscillator using a comprehensive three-dimensional time-dependent simulation tool. Using beam parameters from the University of Hawai`i (UH) at M\\=anoa FEL facility, our study shows that at nominal bunch length, the FEL radiation exhibits superradiant scaling in saturation. We then explore how cavity desynchronization enhances this regime by mitigating the laser lethargy effect in oscillators and improving overlap between the electron bunch and the radiation pulse, with peak power increased by more than a factor of five. Finally, we simulate a short-bunch operational mode with bunch length comparable to the slippage length, which accelerates saturation and further amplifies the FEL power. These findings highlight that the UH M\\=anoa FEL oscillator has the potential to achieve superradiant emission at its nominal operating mode, and that short-bunch operation offers further enhancement while requiring additional optimization.",
