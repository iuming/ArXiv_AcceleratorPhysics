  "title": "Design of a high-resolution ion pulse ionization chamber for 222Rn decays detection in air",
  "abstract": "Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that contributes significantly to human radiation exposure and must be controlled to avoid concentrations harmful to health.   The paper presents an impulse-proportional ionization chamber that is suitable for the direct measurement of low radon concentrations in ambient air and achieves spectroscopic resolutions of 2-3%.   This accuracy can be achieved through two novel principles. Firstly, the double-cylindrical, coaxial design of the IC allows for efficient, nearly complete detection of $α$-radiation. Secondly, a customized measurement method for spectroscopic evaluation was developed to discriminate between the proportions of 222Rn, 218Po, and 214Po and extract their concentrations. Particular attention was paid to the energy resolution of the detection system by suppressing the effects of acoustic and vibration noise on the detector's operation.   The high spectral resolution of the developed ionization chamber, with working volumes of 7.7l and 8.7l, enables measurements with uncertainties of less than 5\\% at 15-minute measurement times in ambient air with $50\\,\\mathrm{Bq/m^3}$ radon activity.",
