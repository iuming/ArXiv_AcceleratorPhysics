  "title": "Classical and quantum beam dynamics simulation of the RF photoinjector test bench",
  "abstract": "We present beam-dynamics simulations for an S-band RF photoinjector test bench under development at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The facility is intended to produce high-quality electron beams and to enable future generation of relativistic vortex electrons carrying quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Simulations of a 1.5-cell RF photogun operating at the currently available accelerating gradient of 45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low bunch charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge effects are weak and the transverse emittance is primarily determined by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and the cathode-region solenoid field results in a robust emittance-compensated regime, yielding a final normalized emittance of 3.2 pi mm mrad. To evaluate the prospects for accelerating vortex electron beams, we further model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The simulations show that acceleration to the multi-MeV energy range significantly suppresses free-space wave-packet spreading and preserves the initial OAM structure, indicating that the proposed test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.",
