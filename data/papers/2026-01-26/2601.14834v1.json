  "title": "Electric field induced by radial redistribution of the energetic ion pressure in a fusion plasma",
  "abstract": "It is found by using the gyrokinetic theory that significant radial electric fields, or zonal flows, can be generated by the radial redistribution of energetic ion pressure in a tokamak fusion device. Trapped energetic ions are more effective to generate the radial electric field than the isotropic energetic ions. This suggests that the energetic $α$ particles produced by DT fusion may induce significant radial electric field and thus help to improve the core plasma confinement in a fusion reactor.",
