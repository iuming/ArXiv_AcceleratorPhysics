  "title": "Reduction of SAXS Signal due to Doppler Broadening Induced Loss of Coherence",
  "abstract": "We present an analytical and numerical study of how Doppler-induced spectral broadening in laser-heated plasmas degrades the coherence of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) signals, and show that the resulting loss of temporal coherence reduces the SAXS intensity. Applying this formalism to two benchmark geometries - single density steps (wires) and periodic gratings -- we obtain analytic estimates. For gratings, finite coherence simultaneously lowers Bragg-peak heights and broadens their widths, whereas for isolated steps only the overall scaling with q affected. We map the parameter space relevant to current SASE and self-seeded XFELs, revealing that Doppler effects remain managable for the trieval of geometry parameters (less than few 10 % error) for SASE bandwidths but become the dominant error source in seeded configurations or above-keV temperatures. Practical consequences for density-gradient retrieval and interface-sharpness measurements are quantified. The results supply clear criteria for when Doppler broadening must be included in SAXS data analysis and offer a route to infer electron temperature directly from coherence-loss signatures.",
