  "title": "Ring oscillator performance of the ATLAS inner tracker pixel readout chip",
  "abstract": "This paper presents experimental and simulation data to characterize the Ring Oscillators (RO) produced in 65-nm CMOS technology for the next promising generation of readout chips for the pixel detector in the Inner Tracker (ITk) at the ATLAS experiment at CERN. To enable a better understanding of the RO block embedded in ITkPixV1.1 single chip card (SCC), tests at various temperatures, voltages, accumulated total ionizing dose (TID) with X-ray irradiation, and high-temperature annealing will be presented. The objective of this study is to examine the RO output dependency based on different variable conditions and provide simulation data using Cadence, an electronic design automation (EDA) software to validate the experimental outcomes.",
