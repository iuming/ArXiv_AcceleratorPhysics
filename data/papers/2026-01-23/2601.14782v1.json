  "title": "Introducing Timepix2-Lite: A Miniaturized Readout Interface Enabling Nanosecond-Scale Half-Life Measurement",
  "abstract": "This paper presents Timepix2 Lite, a compact readout interface for the Timepix2 hybrid pixel detector, designed to provide high spatial and temporal resolution in a wide range of radiation detection applications. The Timepix2 Lite enables simultaneous energy and precise timing measurements on the nanosecond scale and supports advanced real-time data acquisition and visualization through the TrackLab software framework. Its compact and flexible architecture, enabled by the miniaturized design, allows seamless integration into diverse experimental setups, including nuclear spectroscopy, stratospheric balloon missions, and nanosecond-scale half-life measurements. As a case study, the half-life of the second excited state in 237Np was determined to be 67.5(7) ns for the 59.5 keV transition, consistent with previously reported results.",
