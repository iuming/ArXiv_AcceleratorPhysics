  "title": "Electric field-driven Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability in binary complex plasma",
  "abstract": "This study uses two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations to explore Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma, when heavier dust particles are positioned above the lighter ones, having the same charge-to-mass ratio, in a planar configuration. Langevin dynamics simulations are used to study the evolution of perturbations at the interface between these two distinct species of charged dust particles, subject to an externally applied electric field and an equilibrium charge density gradient. We have performed analytical calculations to determine the growth rate of instability under both strongly coupled and weakly coupled dusty plasma regimes. These theoretical predictions are subsequently validated through molecular dynamics simulations, enabling the reproduction of the instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma. The instability in these cases ultimately causes mixing among the charged species. The study comprehensively analyzes the growth rate as a function of various system parameters, and it offers deeper insight into the underlying physical mechanisms.",
