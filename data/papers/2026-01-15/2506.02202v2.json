  "title": "Magnetic field dynamics in presence of Hall conductivity and thermo-diffusion",
  "abstract": "Anisotropy of kinetic coefficients in presence of a magnetic field is   represented by Hall currents, which appear in a collisional medium due to action of the Lorentz force on the charged particles between collisions.   We derive equations, describing dynamics of the magnetic field in presence of thermo-diffusion with Hall currents, using a standard electrodynamic consideration. The influence of the Hall currents, at presence of thermo-diffusion, on the magnetic field structure is considered in simple models. The equation is derived, which includes additional term for a seed magnetic field creation in the non-magnetized plasma, due to thermo-diffusion. This equation describes the action of the seed magnetic field creation by the mechanism known as \"Biermann battery\".",
