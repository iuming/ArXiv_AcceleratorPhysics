  "title": "Constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants",
  "abstract": "Tokamaks differ fundamentally from stellarators in the importance of the external coils for determining the magnetic field structure. Tokamak plasmas are in a self-organized state, especially when fusion rather than external heating dominates. Stellarator optimization focuses on the magnetic fields that can be produced by the coils. Tokamak optimization considers plasma profiles, which are largely determined by microturbulent transport and not easily controlled. A deviation of the profile of the plasma current over its full range of stability against disruptions produces only a small change, $\\sim 10\\%$, in the poloidal flux produced by the plasma current. This offers a simple explanation of why disruptions in tokamaks are so common, and why current-profile control though difficult may be required, especially during plasma shutdowns. The rapid temporal decay of $nτ_ET$ in high performance tokamak experiments shows the need for the careful control for other profiles. Here the focus is on the implications of Faraday's Law since important but new implications are easily derived. The context of the paper is twofold: (1) Simplified statements of the implications of the laws of physics, in particular Faraday's Law, which should be helpful in the design of tokamak power plants. (2) Thoughtful allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.",
