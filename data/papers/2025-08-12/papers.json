    "title": "A Simple Model of Current Ramp-Up and Ramp-Down in Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "A simple model of the ramp-up and ramp-down of the toroidal current in a tokamak plasma is developed. Faraday's law of electric induction is found to limit how rapidly the current can be safety ramped up or down. It is estimated that the minimum safe ramp-up/down times for the JET, SPARC, and ITER tokamaks are 4.2, 2.0, and 14.7 seconds, respectively. The JET ramp time is in accordance with operational experience. The SPARC and ITER minimum safe ramp times are less than the ramp times in the respective designs. Hence, there is no indication that the design ramp times are infeasible, as was recently suggested in arXiv:2507.05456 (2025). The typical ratios of the inductive electric field to the Connor-Hastie field in SPARC and ITER are found to be less than those in JET. Thus, the fact that the JET tokamak was able to operate successfully without encountering runaway electron problems during current ramps suggests that the future SPARC and ITER tokamaks should also be able to avoid such problems.",

    "title": "Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs",
    "abstract": "Persistent single-electron emission (\"hot spots\") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.",

    "title": "Characterization and automated optimization of laser-driven proton beams   from converging liquid sheet jet targets",
    "abstract": "Compact, stable, and versatile laser-driven ion sources hold great promise for applications ranging from medicine to materials science and fundamental physics. While single-shot sources have demonstrated favorable beam properties, including the peak fluxes necessary for several applications, high repetition rate operation will be necessary to generate and sustain the high average flux needed for many of the most exciting applications of laser-driven ion sources. Further, to navigate through the high-dimensional space of laser and target parameters towards experimental optima, it is essential to develop ion acceleration platforms compatible with machine learning learning techniques and capable of autonomous real-time optimization. Here we present a multi-Hz ion acceleration platform employing a liquid sheet jet target. We characterize the laser-plasma interaction and the laser-driven proton beam across a variety of key parameters governing the interaction using an extensive suite of online diagnostics. We also demonstrate real-time, closed-loop optimization of the ion beam maximum energy by tuning the laser wavefront using a Bayesian optimization scheme. This approach increased the maximum proton energy by 11% compared to a manually-optimized wavefront by enhancing the energy concentration within the laser focal spot, demonstrating the potential for closed-loop optimization schemes to tune future ion accelerators for robust high repetition rate operation.",

    "title": "Template masks for 4D-STEM",
    "abstract": "We present a new analysis method for atomic resolution four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM, in which a diffraction pattern is collected at each point of a raster scan of a focused electron beam across the specimen). In 4D-STEM, each measured intensity has a dual character, forming a pixel in a diffraction pattern and, equally, forming a pixel in a STEM image. Applying a mask to the data to obtain a \"virtual\" bright field or dark field image is widely used and understood. However, there is a complementary procedure, in which an image (template) is applied to the data to obtain a mask. This mask shows the correlation between the data and the template and, when applied to atomic resolution 4D-STEM data produces an image optimised for the template. This allows, for example, imaging of specific atom columns and is a significant improvement over user-defined masks such as virtual annular bright field imaging. We demonstrate the capability of the approach, separately imaging Li and O atom columns in LiFePO4 and O, Pb and Ti across a domain wall in PbTiO3.These template masks provide a computationally straightforward and general method to probe 4D-STEM data. They are particularly effective for specimens of moderate thickness where multiple scattering produces strong and specific correlations in diffraction patterns.",

    "abstract": "The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a tonne-scale gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). It is designed to measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution, better than 2% at 1 MeV. To fully achieve its designed performance, precise vertex reconstruction is crucial. This work reports two distinct vertex reconstruction methods, the charge center algorithm (CCA) and the deep learning algorithm (DLA). We describe the efforts in optimizing and improving these two methods and compare their reconstruction performance. The results show that the CCA and DLA methods can achieve vertex position resolutions better than 20mm (bias<5mm) and 12mm (bias<1.3mm) at 1 MeV, respectively, fully meeting the requirements of the TAO experiment. The reconstruction algorithms developed in this study not only prepare the TAO experiment for its upcoming real data but also hold significant potential for application in other similar experiments.",

    "abstract": "The presented study investigates the effects of low fluences from $5\\times10^{12}$ up to $1\\times10^{14}$ particles/cm$^{2}$ of 60MeV proton and neutron irradiation on n-type Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (nLGADs). An nLGAD is a silicon sensor with a highly doped gain layer that enables controlled charge multiplication via impact ionization. In contrast to the well-established p-type LGADs for high-energy physics (HEP) applications, nLGADs are optimized for the detection of low-penetrating particles such as UV photons and soft X-rays. In addition to studying their potential application in environments with radiation backgrounds, these novel devices also enable the exploration of the underlying phenomenology arising from the combination of n-type bulk material with a gain layer, which degradation was previously studied predominantly in the context of p-type LGADs. The irradiation effects were characterized through measurements of the leakage current and capacitance with increasing bias voltage (I-V and C-V), revealing systematic and fluence-dependent behavior related to space charge sign inversion (SCSI) of the n-type bulk material, which especially alters the electric field in the sensor and thus the depletion behavior. Additionally, annealing studies were performed to assess both beneficial and reverse annealing regimes with isothermal and isochronal annealing. The findings are consistent with previous high-energy proton studies and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental behavior of nLGADs under irradiation.",

    "title": "Scanning Acoustic Microscopy for Quantifying Bubble Evolution in   Alkaline Water Electrolyzers",
    "abstract": "Improved understanding of gas/liquid transport in electrochemical gas-evolving systems is increasingly demanded for optimizing device performance. However, high-resolution measurement techniques for in-situ imaging remain limited. This work demonstrates the use of volumetric scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) for quantifying hydrogen bubble evolution in porous nickel electrodes in a customized alkaline water electrolysis cell. By using high-frequency focused ultrasound, SAM enables volumetric imaging with high spatial resolution in the range of tens of micrometers. This allows the distribution of gas bubbles within the complex 3D architecture of porous electrodes to be resolved. Digital image processing methods are used to segment and quantify the gas content in the electrode. Thus, non-destructive SAM imaging is demonstrated to be an accessible and scalable analytical tool for the quantitative investigation of bubble evolution in operando electrochemical environments. Here, a solid foundation is established for future studies aimed at optimizing bubble dynamics and cell design under practically relevant operating conditions, ultimately contributing to higher electrolysis efficiencies.",

    "title": "Constraining Active Galactic Nucleus Jets with Spectrum and Core Shift:   The Case of M87",
    "abstract": "We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet. Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of position, we also find that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows a stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an inverted SED in sub-millimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and VLBI could discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100 Schwarzschild radii.",

    "abstract": "We present the first gyrokinetic simulations of multiscale turbulence in a stellarator, using the magnetic geometry of Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and experimentally relevant parameters. A broad range of scenarios is explored, including regimes where electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) turbulence coexists with varying levels of ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) turbulence, as well as cases involving microtearing modes (MTMs) relevant to high-$\\beta$ and reactor-like conditions. Notably, while ETG turbulence does not form radial streamers as in tokamaks, it can still drive significant transport and interact with ion-scale turbulence. In electrostatic ITG-dominated regimes, electron-scale fluctuations erode zonal flows, enhancing ion-scale transport, while ion-scale turbulence suppresses ETG activity. In contrast, under electromagnetic MTM conditions, the isotropic nature of ETG turbulence limits its suppressive effect, allowing MTMs to persist. These findings underscore the critical role of cross-scale effects for accurate transport predictions in W7-X and future stellarators.",

    "title": "Development and performance test of p-type Silicon pad array detector",
    "abstract": "This article reports on the development and comprehensive evaluation of p-type silicon detector arrays fabricated at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), Mohali, India. The detectors consist of an 8~$\\times$~9 array of 1~$\\times$~1~cm$^2$ pads fabricated on 6-inch wafers and read out using the High Granularity Calorimeter Readout Chip (HGCROC). Electrical characterization of the detector through current vs. voltage (IV) and capacitance vs. voltage (CV) measurements demonstrated consistent breakdown and full depletion voltages across all pads, in agreement with Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) device simulations. Laboratory measurements with a $^{90}$Sr source and beam tests at PS, CERN with 10 GeV pions, showed a clear Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) signal, well separated from the pedestal and uniform response of the pads with an average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio above 5.5. The measured shower profiles with 2-4 GeV positron beams for various thicknesses of a tungsten absorber placed in front of the detector are found to be in agreement with the corresponding Geant4 simulations. The performance test results for the detector show that it is a promising candidate for the future ALICE upgrade detector named Forward Calorimeter (FoCal). The FoCal will have alternating layers of low and high-granularity silicon pad detectors with absorbers as a part of the electromagnetic segment, and along with its hadronic segment, will study the direct photons, neutral hadrons, vector mesons, and jets production in the low Bjorken-x region.",

Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that relativistic self-focusing, aided by a self-generated electron cavity, enhances the laser intensity by more than an order of magnitude, driving the system into the radiation-reaction-dominated regime, i.e. one where the electrons lose a substantial amount of their energy as hard radiation. Peak photon emission occurs near $0.5$ times the relativistic critical density, with a $\\gamma$-photon yield exceeding $20\\%$ of the laser energy. Compared to Ti:Sa lasers of the same power, the longer duration of Nd:glass laser pulses leads to an order of magnitude increase in $\\gamma$-photon number in the extreme conversion efficiency regime, making them particularly well-suited for photonuclear physics applications. These findings point to a robust and scalable mechanism for compact, ultra-bright $\\gamma$-ray generation in the multi-petawatt regime.",

    "abstract": "The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \\textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfv\\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfv\\'enic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfv\\'enic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfv\\'enic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfv\\'enic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal control of laser pulses at relativistic intensities is a longstanding goal with broad implications in laser-plasma acceleration, high-brightness radiation sources, and extreme-field science. Laser pulses with helical spatiotemporal intensity profiles, often referred to as light springs, carry multiple spectral and orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes, producing a rotating intensity profile capable of coupling directly to helical plasma waves. Until now, light springs have only been realized on low-power systems, limited by optical damage thresholds and large-aperture beamline constraints. Here, we report the first experimental realization of light springs at relativistic intensities, achieving peak intensities above $1.4\\times10^{18}$ W/cm$^{2}$. Our approach spectrally splits a high-power laser pulse, imprints distinct helical phases on each component, and coherently recombines them. Hyperspectral imaging, off-axis holography, and spectral phase reconstruction confirm excellent agreement with theory and reveal the potential to drive superluminal rotational velocities. Introducing spectral chirp demonstrates further control of the temporal evolution of the transverse mode structure. This platform opens new regimes of ultra-intense laser-plasma interaction where laser OAM can directly couple to plasma OAM.",

    "abstract": "A linearized Vlasov-Poisson system of equations is transformed into a Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which is used to demonstrate that the fluctuation theorem holds for the relative stochastic entropy, defined in terms of the probability density functional of the particle velocity distribution function in the Landau damping process. The difference between the energy perturbation, normalized by the equilibrium temperature, and the entropy perturbation constitutes a time-independent invariant of the system. This invariant takes the quadratic form of the perturbed velocity distribution function and corresponds to the squared amplitude of the state vector that satisfies the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. Exact solutions, constructed from a discrete set of Hamiltonian eigenvectors, are employed to formulate and numerically validate the fluctuation theorem for the Landau damping process. The results offer new insights into the formulations of collisionless plasma processes within the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.",

    "title": "Energetics and limitations of passive electron transpiration cooling for   hypersonic leading edges",
    "abstract": "Electron transpiration cooling (ETC) offers a promising approach for thermal management of hypersonic vehicles by leveraging thermionic emission from the leading edge. While emitted electrons cool the surface, subsequent collection of flowfield electrons induces heating, limiting ETC effectiveness unless collection occurs in cooler aftbody regions. Most existing ETC studies neglect this heating contribution, assuming ideal downstream collection. This work integrates a one-dimensional collisionless plasma sheath model into a discretized leading-edge framework to predict surface potentials and charged-particle fluxes. A parametric study examines how plasma and vehicle properties affect ETC performance. Results reveal that passive ETC is susceptible to thermionic space-charge overcompensation, which can reverse the intended cooling effect and cause surface heating at high plasma densities. Flowfield electron heating can be mitigated but not eliminated by using dielectric coatings or blunt geometries. The same mechanisms that protect blunt bodies from adverse electrical conduction and flowfield heating also preclude incorporation of ETC-based cooling in those vehicle geometries.",

    "abstract": "Mercier's criterion is typically enforced as a hard operational limit in stellarator design. At the same time, past experimental and numerical studies have shown that this limit may often be surpassed, though the exact mechanism behind this nonlinear stability is not well understood. This work aims to contribute to our current understanding by comparing the nonlinear evolution of Mercier unstable Wendelstein stellarators to that of nonlinearly stable quasi-interchange modes in tokamaks. A high mirror, very low $\\iota$, W7-X-like configuration is first simulated. A second case is then considered using experimental reconstructions of intermediate $\\beta$ W7-AS discharges, where saturated low-n modes were observed experimentally, with sustained MHD signatures over tens of milliseconds. The possible reasons for the discrepancies between experiment and simulation, and the observation of partial reconnection in contrast to flux pumping are discussed, in view of reproducing and designing for operation of stellarators beyond the Mercier stability limit.",

    "abstract": "As liquid xenon time projection chambers scale to ever-larger sizes, so too do the engineering challenges they pose. We describe a large, flexible, multipurpose test facility capable of supporting the development of a number of key aspects of liquid xenon detector systems. Example applications of this facility include characterization of large-area light and charge sensor arrays, tests of xenon purification techniques and materials compatibility, and investigations into high-voltage phenomena. This facility uses an automated and remotely monitored cryo-cooling system based on immersion of the test chamber in a liquid bath rather than conductive coupling, leading to advantages in temperature and pressure stability, as well as increasing required response times in the case of cooling-power loss. Design advantages, operational procedures, and performance of the facility are described, as well as five examples of liquid xenon test chambers that use the facility.",

    "abstract": "Refraction of an optical probe beam by a plasma can be measured with angular filter refractometry (AFR), which produces an image containing intensity contours that correspond to curves of constant refraction angle. Further analysis is required to reconstruct the underlying line-integrated electron density. Most prior efforts to calculate density from AFR data have been limited to 1D analysis or forward-fitting techniques. In this paper, we detail the use of a fast marching Eikonal solver to directly invert AFR data and obtain the 2D line-integrated electron density. The analysis method is first verified with synthetic data and then applied to laser-driven experiments of single and double plume expansion collected at the OMEGA EP Laser Facility. The calculated densities agree with 1D results and are shown to be consistent with the original AFR measurements via forward modeling. We also discuss how additional measurements could improve the precision of this technique.",

    "abstract": "Rare event searches such as neutrinoless double beta decay and Weakly Interacting Massive Particle detection require ultra-low background detectors. Radon contamination is a significant challenge for these experiments, which employ highly sensitive radon assay techniques to identify and select low-emission materials. This work presents the development of ultra-sensitive electrostatic chamber (ESC) instruments designed to measure radon emanation in a recirculating gas loop, for future lower background experiments. Unlike traditional methods that separate emanation and detection steps, this system allows continuous radon transport and detection. This is made possible with a custom-built recirculation pump. A Python-based analysis framework, PyDAn, was developed to process and fit time-dependent radon decay data. Radon emanation rates are given for various materials measured with this instrument. A radon source of known activity provides an absolute calibration, enabling statistically-limited minimal detectable activities of 20 $\\mu$Bq. These devices are powerful tools for screening materials in the development of low-background particle physics experiments.",

    "abstract": "A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3 offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.",

    "title": "Transport of Particles in Strongly Turbulent 3D Magnetized Plasmas",
    "abstract": "In this review, we examine particle transport in strongly turbulent three-dimensional (3D) magnetized plasmas, characterized by intense (large-amplitude) magnetic field fluctuations. Such environments naturally give rise to a network of coherent structures (CoSs), including current sheets, filaments, shocks, switchbacks, and significant magnetic perturbations, which critically influence particle dynamics at the kinetic level. Within this turbulent regime, two fundamental particle energization mechanisms emerge, stochastic acceleration and systematic acceleration. Systematic acceleration within open turbulent volumes promotes the development of power-law tails in energy distributions. Our analysis distinguishes the roles of two electric fields: the perpendicular (or convective) fields, which drive stochastic heating via interactions with randomly moving scatterers, and the parallel electric fields, which enable systematic particle acceleration in regions of strong currents. Combined with accurate estimates of particle escape times in finite volumes, the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the formation of Kappa distributions. The transport properties differ significantly between the two energization modes. Stochastic energization follows Gaussian statistics and can be effectively described by the Fokker-Planck equation. In contrast, systematic acceleration exhibits Levy flight statistics, necessitating a fractional transport equation for an accurate description. Furthermore, the fractal spatial distribution of CoSs introduces deviations from traditional transport models, influencing e.g. particle escape times. Systematic acceleration is most efficient during the early, high-energy phases of turbulence, while stochastic heating becomes dominant during the later stages, contributing to gradual particle energization.",

    "abstract": "The AQUA beamline of the EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB facility is a SASE free-electron laser designed to operate in the water window, in the 3-4 nm wavelength range. The electron beam driving this source is accelerated up to about 1-1.2 GeV by an X-band normal conducting linear accelerator, followed by a plasma wakefield acceleration stage. The main radiator consists of an array of ten APPLE-X permanent magnet undulator modules, each 2 m long and with a period length of 18 mm. Tolerance analyses against resistive wall wakefields and injection misalignments at undulator entrance are performed, and the related effects on the laser yield performance are evaluated and discussed.",

    "title": "Frobenius-Perron Operator Approach to the Beam-Beam Interaction in   Circular Colliders",
    "abstract": "Unlike most publications devoted to the application of the self-consistent method of the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system to the study of beam-beam interaction, in this article an alternative strategy using the elegant approach of the Frobenius-Perron operator for symplectic twist maps has been developed. A detailed analysis of the establishment of an equilibrium density distribution in phase space, as well as the behavior of the perturbed distribution function with respect to the coherent stability of the two beams, has been carried out.   Using the Renormalization Group technique for the reduction of the Frobenius-Perron operator, the case where the unperturbed rotation frequency (unperturbed betatron tune) of the map is far from any structural resonance driven by the beam-beam kick perturbation has been analyzed in detail. It has been shown that up to second order in the beam-beam parameter, the renormalized map propagator with nonlinear stabilization describes a random walk of the angle variable, implying that there exists an equilibrium distribution function depending only on the action variable.   The linearized Frobenius-Perron operators for each beam imply a discrete form of the linearized Vlasov equations, which essentially comprises a new method for calculating coherent beam-beam instabilities using a matrix mapping technique. In the special case of an isolated coherent beam-beam resonance, a stability criterion for coherent beam-beam resonances has been found in closed form.   An intriguing particular concerning the effect of repeated beam-beam collisions on collider luminosity has been derived explicitly. An addition of luminosity per kick (small though, of the order of the beam-beam parameter) in the course of successive beam-beam collisions could be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This information-theoretic analysis may provide a theoretical basis for regulating turbulence by controlling zonal flow.",

    "abstract": "The effect of magnetic shear on ballooning-driven plasma edge turbulence is studied through nonlinear simulations complemented by linear numerical and analytical investigations. Nonlinear, 3D, global, flux-driven simulations using the GBS code show that the scale separation between radial, x, and poloidal, y, size of turbulent eddies, kx << ky , considered by Ricci et al. (2008) and extensively used to predict pressure gradient lengths, SOL width, particle and heat fluxes, is observed with high magnetic shear. In contrast, for low magnetic shear, kx ~ ky is observed, with fluctuation properties resembling those shown by recent low-shear stellarator simulations reported in Coelho et al. (2024a). Global linear investigations of the ballooning mode qualitatively captures the transition in mode structure with varying magnetic shear, showing that kx << ky is achieved with sufficiently strong poloidal mode coupling enhanced by increasing magnetic shear, resistivity, toroidal mode number, and equilibrium gradient scale length. This is confirmed by an analytical study considering a dominant poloidal mode and its sidebands, which highlights that the poloidal mode structure is determined by curvature and k parallel effects",

We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments and gains acceleration on GPUs. It is suitable for dynode PMTs, and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the conventional method of waveform integration.",

    "title": "Detection of New Auroral Emissions at Io and Implications for Its   Interaction with the Plasma Torus",
    "abstract": "We observed Io's optical aurora in eclipse on six nights between 2022 and 2024 using Keck I/HIRES. Spectra revealed 13 new auroral emissions not identified previously, tripling the total number of optical emissions lines detected at Io. These included the O I lines at 777.4 and 844.6 nm, the Na I lines at 818.3 and 819.5 nm, the [S I] lines at 458.9 and 772.5 nm, the S I triplet at 922.3 nm, the [O II] lines at 732.0 and 733.0 nm and the [S II] lines at 406.9, 407.6, 671.6 and 673.1 nm. We leveraged these new detections by comparing with imaging data from the 2001 Cassini flyby to better understand the distribution of atmospheric species and their contribution to the observed auroral brightnesses. Our auroral emission model showed that the observed 557.7, 777.4 and 844.6 nm oxygen emission line brightnesses could be explained by excitation by electron impact of canonical 5 eV torus electrons on an atmosphere composed of O, SO2 and an isoelectronic proxy for SO. The SO2 emission did not decrease immediately after eclipse ingress, suggesting the emitting column may be restricted to higher altitudes. The derived O/SO2 mixing ratio was typically about 10%, but it also exhibited order-of-magnitude variance during some observations. Io's 630.0 nm [O I] brightness did not strongly vary with plasma sheet distance, suggesting electron flux at Io varies substantially beyond model predictions.",

    "title": "Electrodeless Magnetohydrodynamic Local Force Generator for Aerocapture",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system for planetary entry aerocapture. The system is advantaged over previous approaches by having the following two characteristics: (i) it can be deployed locally to one or various flow regions, and (ii) it does not make use of electrodes. Previous MHD systems for planetary entry were either electrodeless global systems or two-electrode local systems. The proposed novel MHD system employs two magnets to establish a current loop resulting in a Faraday electromotive force (EMF). The first magnet is positioned to ensure the magnetic field faces outward from the shell, while the second magnet is oriented to ensure the magnetic field faces inward toward the shell. Preliminary findings demonstrate that when located on the surface of an Earth entry capsule at a flight Mach number of 35, the novel electrodeless MHD system can generate forces several times greater than a two-electrode system while utilizing the same magnetic field strength. The study is conducted entirely through numerical simulation using CFDWARP, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code that employs advanced numerical methods allowing for the full coupling between aerodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and non-neutral plasma sheaths. The physical model includes an 11-species finite-rate chemical solver including real gas effects, the drift-diffusion model for all charged species, along with an electric field potential equation that satisfies Gauss's law.",

    "title": "Controlling the electric force on a dust particle during the afterglow   of a plasma at a higher gas pressure",
    "abstract": "When dust particles are immersed in a plasma, and the power that sustains a plasma is terminated, the charge of dust particles will change in the early afterglow, as electrons and ions gradually diminish in number. The possibility of controlling this charge, along with the electric force acting on the particles in the late afterglow, has earlier been demonstrated at a low gas pressure of 8 mTorr. Here, it is confirmed experimentally that controlling particles is possible also at a higher gas pressure of 90 mTorr, in a capacitively coupled radio-frequency plasma (CCP). A timed application of a DC electric field during the afterglow is a key element of this control scheme. Analyzing the experimental results, the electric force in the late afterglow was determined by comparing measurements of particle velocity to a prediction made by integrating the equation of motion, taking into account gas friction. In addition to applying friction to dust particles, gas also slows the drifting motion of electrons and ions, reducing their energy during the afterglow, but nevertheless we find that dust particles become charged in the afterglow so that one can apply an electric force to them that is comparable to the gravitational force, even at a higher pressure than had previously been demonstrated. This result extends the parameter range for which it is expected that particle contamination in semiconductor manufacturing can be mitigated by controlling charge and forces during the afterglow. Because of the way that forces scale with particle size, it is expected that submicron particles can be controlled even more easily than the larger spheres in the present experiment.",

    "abstract": "Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.",

    "abstract": "The flux of cosmic ray muons at the Earth's surface exhibits seasonal variations due to changes in the temperature of the atmosphere affecting the production and decay of mesons in the upper atmosphere. Using data collected by the NOvA Near Detector during 2018--2022, we studied the seasonal pattern in the multiple-muon event rate. The data confirm an anticorrelation between the multiple-muon event rate and effective atmospheric temperature, consistent across all the years of data. Previous analyses from MINOS and NOvA saw a similar anticorrelation but did not include an explanation. We find that this anticorrelation is driven by altitude--geometry effects as the average muon production height changes with the season. This has been checked with a CORSIKA cosmic ray simulation package by varying atmospheric parameters, and provides an explanation to a longstanding discrepancy between the seasonal phases of single and multiple-muon events.",

    "abstract": "Sapphire has mechanical and electrical properties that are advantageous for the construction of internal components of radiation detectors such as time projection chambers and bolometers. However, it has proved difficult to assess its $\\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\\rm ^{238}U$ content down to the picogram per gram level. This work reports an experimental verification of a computational study that demonstrates $\\gamma\\gamma$ coincidence counting, coupled with neutron activation analysis (NAA), can reach ppt sensitivities. Combining results from $\\gamma\\gamma$ coincidence counting with those of earlier single-$\\gamma$ counting based NAA shows that a sample of Saint Gobain sapphire has $\\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\\rm ^{238}U$ concentrations of $<0.26$ ppt and $<2.3$ ppt, respectively; the best constraints on the radiopurity of sapphire.",

    "title": "Stabilization and Re-excitation of Sawtooth Oscillations due to   Energetic Particles in Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "Sawtooth oscillations, driven by internal kink modes (IKMs), are fundamental phenomena in tokamak plasmas. They can be classified into different types, including normal sawteeth, small sawteeth, and in some cases, evolving into the steady-island state, each having a different impact on energy confinement in fusion reactors. This study investigates the interaction between sawtooth oscillations and energetic particles (EPs) using the initial-value MHD-kinetic hybrid code CLT-K, which can perform long-term self-consistent nonlinear simulations. We analyze the redistribution of EPs caused by sawtooth crashes and the effect of EPs on sawtooth behavior and type transitions. The results show that co-passing EPs tend to re-excite sawtooth oscillations, extending their period, while counter-passing EPs promote the system evolution toward small sawteeth, potentially leading to the steady-island state. Additionally, we provide a physical picture of how EPs influence sawtooth type through the mechanism of magnetic flux pumping. We demonstrate that the radial residual flow in the core plays a crucial role in determining the reconnection rate and sawtooth type. Moreover, we observe new phenomena about couplings of various instabilities, such as the excitation of global multi-mode toroidal Alfv\\'en eigenmodes (TAEs) due to EP redistribution following a sawtooth crash and the excitation of the resonant tearing mode (r-TM) when injecting counter-passing EPs. The study also explores the impact of EP energy and the safety factor profile on the development of stochastic magnetic fields and EP transport. These findings emphasize the necessity of multi-mode simulations in capturing the complexity of EP-sawtooth interactions and provide insights for optimizing sawtooth control in future reactors such as ITER.",

    "title": "Stimulated Brillouin Amplification with Flying Focus",
    "abstract": "Material damage thresholds pose a fundamental limit to chirped pulse amplification (CPA) in high-power laser systems. Plasma-based amplification via stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) offers a damage-free alternative, yet its effectiveness has been hindered by instabilities that constrain interaction length. In this study, we report the first experimental demonstration of SBS amplification driven by a flying focus in a 3-mm plasma channel. The flying focus is generated using chromatic aberration from spherical lenses, with its velocity precisely measured by an interferometric ionization method achieving 6.6 fs timing resolution. At a focus velocity near -c, SBS amplification is realized at pump and seed intensities more than two orders of magnitude lower than in conventional setups, yielding a conversion efficiency of 14.5%. These results validate flying focus as a powerful tool for extending interaction lengths and enabling efficient plasma-based laser amplification at reduced intensities.",

Its optical subsystem, designed based on a modeled laser beam path, places optical elements with sub-millimeter accuracy on a custom-machined aluminum plate, allowing straightforward assembly without extensive alignment and providing high mechanical stability. The module maintains frequency-stable operation for several months without user intervention and exhibits high robustness to mechanical vibrations up to 4g.

    "abstract": "Independent control of numerous electrodes in quantum charge-coupled device architectures presents a significant challenge for wiring and hardware scalability. To address this issue, we demonstrate a voltage control method based on time-division multiplexing (TDM). This approach utilizes a single high-update-rate digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to sequentially generate control signals for multiple electrodes, thereby reducing both the number of required DACs and associated wiring. We experimentally validate this concept by developing a 10-channel system that operates with only two DACs. The developed TDM-based voltage control system is applied to a surface-electrode trap, where we successfully trap a single $^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion. This approach offers a resource-efficient and scalable solution for advanced quantum computing systems based on trapped ions.",

    "abstract": "We present a comparative study of transport in two optimized stellarator configurations: Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and a recent design called Quasi-Symmetric Turbulence Konzept (QSTK). Using global Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC), we explore the role of zonal flows (ZFs) in suppressing electrostatic Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven turbulence in both configurations. The simulations reveal that ZFs significantly reduce ion heat transport in both W7-X and QSTK, with a lower value of heat flux on the latter configuration, as suggested by the apparently higher linear threshold (''critical'') gradients for ITG modes. The study also highlights that both stellarators exhibit similar mode structures. The results support the notion that linear stability measures, in combination with nonlinear stabilization by zonal flows, can play an important role in the suppression of nonlinear heat fluxes.",

Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.",

The comparison between experiment and theory always occurs via numerical simulations, but the lack of quantitative uncertainty bounds for the latter means that the origin of any discrepancies cannot be identified conclusively. Here I present a simulation framework that can place meaningful bounds on the theory uncertainties inherent to its operation. This work shows that the use of the locally constant field approximation leads to a theory uncertainty of a few per cent in the signals of quantum radiation reaction expected in near-term experiments.",

In this Letter, we present the beam physics and experimental demonstration of a new method that, for the first time, enables simultaneous control of bunch duration and synchronization with few-fs precision. Timing stabilization is achieved using a tailored high-gradient $\\alpha$-magnet that optimizes the correlation between time of flight and momentum, together with a photocathode RF gun designed to suppress the effect of RF-to-laser timing jitter. Compression is realized by manipulating the time-momentum correlation in phase space, primarily through space-charge effects. Sub-5-fs rms bunch duration and synchronization are demonstrated. This method establishes a new regime in electron bunch control, unlocking new capabilities for ultrafast beam physics and applications.",

Holovibes integrates spatial demodulation techniques, such as Fresnel transformations and angular spectrum propagation, with temporal analysis methods including short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and principal component analysis (PCA) in a unified pipeline. By leveraging CUDA-based GPU acceleration, multithreaded parallelism, and efficient buffering, the system achieves high-throughput, low-latency processing suitable for demanding computational imaging applications. We demonstrate sustained real-time hologram rendering of 256x256-pixel from interferograms acquired by a streaming camera at 71,400 frames per second on commodity hardware with no frame loss, while maintaining an end-to-end latency of 30 ms. The engine also supports simultaneous recording of raw or processed data, enabling high-speed acquisition workflows essential for experimental applications. This work represents a significant advance over prior digital holography systems and provides a versatile platform for ultra-high-speed, real-time computational imaging.",

    "title": "Neural Field-Based 3D Surface Reconstruction of Microstructures from   Multi-Detector Signals in Scanning Electron Microscopy",
    "abstract": "The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a widely used imaging device in scientific research and industrial applications. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) SEM images do not directly reveal the three-dimensional (3D) topography of micro samples, motivating the development of SEM 3D surface reconstruction methods. However, reconstruction of complex microstructures remains challenging for existing methods due to the limitations of discrete 3D representations, the need for calibration with reference samples, and shadow-induced gradient errors. Here, we introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D reconstruction method that takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural field representation. NFH-SEM eliminates the manual calibration procedures through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from SEM images during training, enabling accurate reconstruction of intricate microstructures. We validate the effectiveness of NFH-SEM on real and simulated datasets. Our experiments show high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse, challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and broad applicability.",
