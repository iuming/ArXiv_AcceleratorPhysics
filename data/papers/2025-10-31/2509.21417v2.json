  "title": "Coherently Enhanced Axion-Photon Conversion via Seeded Photons for   Short-Pulse Axion Detection",
  "abstract": "We propose a seeded axion-photon conversion scheme to enhance the sensitivity of light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) experiments for axion detection, where the axions are generated from short pulse lasers and the usual resonant cavity is not applicable. By injecting a weak, coherent seed electromagnetic (EM) field into the axion-photon conversion region, the axion-induced EM field can constructively interfere with the seed field, amplifying the number of regenerated photons to a level exceeding that of the unseeded scenario. We evaluate the expected signal enhancement, statistical limits from Poisson counting with seed fluctuations and background, and the potential improvement in coupling sensitivity. Compared to a standard LSW setup, the seeded scheme can achieve orders-of-magnitude higher photon yield per axion, potentially surpassing resonance-enhanced experiments in certain parameter regimes. This approach presents a promising pathway to extend the reach of laboratory axion searches, particularly in scenarios where the resonant cavities are impractical.",
