  "title": "Magnetic Field Line Chaos, Cantori, and Turnstiles in Toroidal Plasmas",
  "abstract": "Although magnetic field line chaos, cantori, and turnstiles underlie the physics of tokamak disruptions, runaway electron damage, stellarator non-resonant divertors, and the most important electromagnetic correction to what are called electrostatic micro-instabilities, these concepts are not well known. These concepts will be defined and applications that illustrate their importance will be discussed.",
