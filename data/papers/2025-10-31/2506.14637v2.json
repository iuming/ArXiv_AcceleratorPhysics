  "title": "A New cw-NMR Q-meter for Dynamically Polarized Targets for Particle   Physics",
  "abstract": "Polarized solid targets produced via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization rely on Continuous-Wave Nuclear Magnetism Resonance measurements to accurately determine the degree of polarization of bulk samples polarized to nearly 100%. Since the late 1970's phase sensitive detection methods have been utilized to observe the magnetization of a sample as a small change in inductance under RF excitation near the Larmor frequency of the nuclear species of interest, using a device known as a Q-meter. Liverpool Q-meters, produced in the UK in the 80's and 90's, have been the workhorse devices for these targets for decades, however their age and scarcity has meant new systems are needed. We describe a Q-meter system designed and built at Jefferson Lab in the Liverpool style to have comparable electronic performance with several improvements to update and adapt the devices for modern use.",
