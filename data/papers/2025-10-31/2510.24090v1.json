  "title": "Tritiated methane reduction in the PandaX-4T experiment via purge and   cryogenic distillation processes",
  "abstract": "Tritium from tritiated methane (CH$_3$T) calibration is a significant impurity that restricts the sensitivity of the PandaX-4T dark matter detection experiment in the low-energy region. The CH$_3$T removal is essential for PandaX-4T and other liquid xenon dark matter direct detection experiments, as CH$_3$T serves as a critical component for low-energy calibration. To eliminate CH$_3$T, the xenon in the detector is suitably recuperated, leaving 1.8 bar of xenon gas inside, and the detector is flushed with heated xenon gas. Concurrently, leveraging the lower boiling point of methane relative to xenon, the PandaX-4T cryogenic distillation system is effectively utilized to extract CH$_3$T from xenon after optimizing the operational parameters. Following the commissioning run, 5.7 tons of xenon are purified via the distillation method. Recent data indicate that the CH$_3$T concentration reduces from $3.6\\times10^{-24}$ mol/mol to $5.9\\times10^{-25}$ mol/mol, demonstrating that gas purging and distillation are effective in removing CH$_3$T, even at concentrations on the order of $10^{-24}$ mol/mol.",
