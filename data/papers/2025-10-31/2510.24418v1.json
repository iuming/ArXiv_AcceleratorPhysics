  "title": "ASTAROTH: A Novel Detector for Dark Matter Direct Detection Using   Cryogenic SiPMs",
  "abstract": "The DAMA experiment's long-standing claim of dark matter detection remains a key open issue in astroparticle physics. Independent verification requires NaI(Tl)-based detectors with enhanced low-energy sensitivity. Current detectors rely on photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which features limited detection efficiency, intrinsic radioactivity, and high noise at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project that developed a proof of concept NaI(Tl) detector where siliconphotomultipliers (SiPMs) have been used instead of PMTs, offering higher photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most of all, a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the dark noise. The setup includes a custom cryostat operating at approximately 80 K. We report the first characterization of an approximately 360 g NaI(Tl) crystal coupled to a 5 x 5 cm SiPM matrix, yielding 4.5 photoelectrons\\keV after crosstalk correction. This promising result demonstrates the feasibility of SiPM-based readout for NaI(Tl) and paves the way for future large-scale dark matter experiments.",
