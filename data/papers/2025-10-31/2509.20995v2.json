  "title": "Three Dimensional Theory of the Ion Channel Laser",
  "abstract": "The ion channel laser (ICL) is a plasma-based alternative to the free electron laser (FEL) that uses the electric field of a uniform-density ion channel rather than the magnetic field of an undulator to induce transverse oscillations of electrons in an ultrarelativistic bunch and thereby produce coherent radiation via a collective electromagnetic instability. The powerful focusing of the ion channel generally yields significantly higher gain parameters in the ICL as compared to the FEL. This permits lasing in extremely short distances using electron bunches with an energy spread as large as a few percent; a value readily achievable with current plasma-based accelerators. ICLs, however, impose stringent transverse phase space requirements on the electron bunch beyond what is required in FELs. In this work, we present a novel 3D theory of the planar off-axis configuration of the ICL that accounts for a number of effects including diffraction, transverse radiation profile, frequency and betatron phase detuning, and nonzero spread in energy and undulator parameter. We derive the ICL pendulum and field equations, which we use to write down the 3D Maxwell-Klimontovich equations. After linearizing, we obtain an integro-differential equation describing the $z$-evolution of the radiation field. The 3D ICL dispersion relation is obtained using a Van Kampen normal mode expansion. We numerically solve the $z$-evolution equation to compute radiation power growth rates and transverse radiation profiles over a range of different ICL parameters. We examine the gain reduction due to 3D effects, energy spread, and emittance. Electron bunch phase space and emittance requirements for lasing are derived. Finally, we make general observations about the performance and feasibility of the ICL and discuss future prospects.",
