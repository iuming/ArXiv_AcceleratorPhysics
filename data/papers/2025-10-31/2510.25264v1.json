  "title": "Development of a new phase-retrieval algorithm from a single-shot image   for X-ray schlieren microscopy",
  "abstract": "In this paper, a new phase-retrieval algorithm from an X-ray schlieren image is proposed. The schlieren method allows phase-contrast imaging with an objective lens and a knife-edge filter placed at the back focal plane of the objective. This method finds a wide range of applications in the visible-light region for transparent specimen visualization. The schlieren contrast does not directly correspond to the phase shift. However, the phase map can be reconstructed from a single-shot schlieren image of a transparent and weak-phase object using the filtered Fourier transform method. A proof-of-principle experiment was performed in the hard-X-ray region at the AR-NE1A beamline of the Photon Factory facility at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK).",
