  "title": "LLRF System Analysis for the Fermilab PIP-II Superconducting LINAC",
  "abstract": "PIP-II is a superconducting linac that is in the initial acceleration chain for the Fermilab accelerator complex. The RF system consists of a warm front-end with an RFQ and buncher cavities along with 25 superconducting cryo-modules comprised of cavities with five different acceleration \\(\\beta\\). The LLRF system for the linac has to provide field and resonance control for a total of 125 RF cavities. Various components of the LLRF system have been tested with and without beam at the PIP-II test stands. The LLRF system design is derived from the LCLS-II project with its self-excited loop architecture used in the majority of the cryo-modules. The PIP-II beam loading at 2 mA is much higher than the LCLS-II linac. The control system architecture is analyzed and evaluated for the operational limits of feedback gains and their ability to meet the project regulation requirements for cavity field amplitude and phase regulation.",
