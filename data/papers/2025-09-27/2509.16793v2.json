  "title": "Galilean Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell Code",
  "abstract": "We introduce a Galilean electromagnetic particle-in-cell (GEM-PIC) algorithm, which transforms the full set of Maxwell equations and the Vlasov equation into the boosted coordinates. This approach preserves the electromagnetic structure of the interaction while exploiting scale separation for computational effi ciency. Unlike quasistatic methods, GEM-PIC does not have to distinguish between beam and streaming particles, allowing a self-consistent treatment of particle trapping. The EM-PIC algorithm allows for highly effi cient and accurate simulations of plasma-based wakefield acceleration.",
