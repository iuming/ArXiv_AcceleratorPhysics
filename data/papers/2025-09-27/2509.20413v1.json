  "title": "Introduction to Engineering Materials",
  "abstract": "This lecture presents an overview of the basic concepts and fundamentals of Engineering Materials within the framework of accelerator applications. After a short introduction, main concepts relative to the structure of matter are reviewed, like crystalline structures, defects and dislocations, phase diagrams and transformations. The microscopic description is correlated with physical properties of materials, focusing in metallurgical aspects like deformation and strengthening. Main groups of materials are addressed and described, namely, metals and alloys, ceramics, polymers, composite materials, and advanced materials, where brush-strokes of tangible applications in particle accelerators and detectors are given. Deterioration aspects of materials are also presented, like corrosion in metals and degradation in plastics.",
