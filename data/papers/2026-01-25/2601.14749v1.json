  "title": "Triggers for plasma detachment bifurcation in the edge divertor region of tokamaks",
  "abstract": "We report the discovery of the trigger for detachment bifurcation phenomenon in tokamak divertors, revealed through steady-state and time-dependent UEDGE simulations: The observed electron temperature cliff at the outer target in DIII-D H-mode plasmas with ion $B\\times \\nabla B$ drift driven into the active divertor results from a bifurcation-induced $T_e$ drop above the X-point accompanied by reversal of the $E\\times B$ flow pattern in the private flux region. Time-dependent simulations reveal a two-phase transition mechanism: the high-field-side radiation front first extends across the last closed flux surface and stabilizes above the X-point, causing local $T_e$ to drop from $\\sim 70\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ to $\\sim 10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and inducing $E\\times B$ flow reversal in a thin layer below the X-point, which lasts $< 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$; Flow reversal below the X-point subsequently triggers the sharp drop in outer target temperature on a timescale of $1-2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, establishing deep detachment a few ms thereafter. A bifurcation transition occurs when the high-field-side radiation front crosses the separatrix while the outer divertor remains attached, with the $T_e$ cliff manifesting distinctly when the outer target $T_e \\gtrsim 10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ prior to the bifurcation. These results demonstrate that the bifurcation is linked to in-out divertor asymmetry and asymmetric radiation front evolution.",
