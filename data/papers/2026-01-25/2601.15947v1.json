  "title": "Multimodal Imaging System Combining Hyperspectral and Laser Speckle Imaging for In Vivo Hemodynamic and Metabolic Monitoring",
  "abstract": "We present the development and validation of a novel multimodal optical imaging platform that integrates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) to enable real-time, non-invasive mapping of tissue oxygenation, perfusion and metabolism, via blood flowmetry and targeting of oxy- (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), as well as oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO). The system architecture features a single high-speed camera and dual optical path, with synchronized alternating illumination: a filtered, supercontinuum laser for HSI and a He-Ne laser for LSCI. The system performances were evaluated through in vivo experiments on rat spinal cord under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, revealing coherent physiological changes in hemodynamics, metabolism and relative blood flow index (rBFI). These results demonstrate the potential of the platform for functional tissue imaging and quantitative dynamic monitoring of both oxygen delivery and consumption.",
