  "title": "CEPC Project Status",
  "abstract": "In this article we give a brief historical review of particle physics achievement through e+e- colliders and proton accelerators in the last half century and perspective for the next half century with worldwide consensus. The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a Higgs factory proposed by Chinese scientists in 2012, and its Technical Design Report (TDR) has been completed in Dec. 2023. Since 2024 CEPC has entered into Engineering Design Report (EDR) phase (2024-2027) and CEPC detector reference design report (Ref-TDR) has been released in Oct. 2025. CEPC plans to apply for the starting the construction in the 16th five year plan (2030-2035).",
