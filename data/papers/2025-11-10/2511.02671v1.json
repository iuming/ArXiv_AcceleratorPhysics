  "title": "Time-based Selection of Kaonic Atom X-ray Events with   Quasi-Hemispherical CZT Detectors at the DAFNE collider",
  "abstract": "This work presents the results of a time-based event selection for searching X-ray signals from kaonic atom X-ray transition using a single quasi-hemispherical Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) detector at the DA$\\Phi$NE collider. To mitigate the high background level in the measured X-ray spectrum, a dedicated event selection strategy was developed, exploiting the precise timing correlation between e+e- collisions and detector signals. This approach enabled, for the first time, the observation of two characteristic X-ray transitions from kaonic aluminum atoms using a CZT detector: for the 5-4 transition at 50~keV, 362~$\\pm$~41~(stat.)~$\\pm$~20~(sys.) signal events over 1698~$\\pm$~197~(stat.)~$\\pm$~25~(sys.) background events in 5$\\sigma$ were observed, with a resolution of 9.2\\%~FWHM; for the 4-3 transition at 106~keV, 295~$\\pm$~50~(stat.)~$\\pm$~20~(sys.) signal events over 2939~$\\pm$~500~(stat.)~$\\pm$~16~(sys.) background events in 5$\\sigma$ were measured, with a resolution of 6.6 ~FWHM. A strong background suppression of approximately 95\\% of the triggered data was achieved through this time-based selection. The demonstrated timing capability of the CZT detector proved highly effective in isolating time-correlated events within an 80 ns window, setting an important benchmark for the application of these semiconductors in timing-based X-ray spectroscopy. These results highlight the potential of CZT-based detection systems for future precision measurements in high-radiation environments, paving the way for compact, room-temperature X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray spectrometers in fundamental physics and beyond.",
