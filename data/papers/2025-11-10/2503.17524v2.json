  "title": "Temperature-Dependent Calibration Procedures for the Silicon   Photomultiplier Readout of the Cosmic Ray Veto Detector for the Mu2e   Experiment",
  "abstract": "The cosmic ray veto detector for the Mu2e experiment consists of scintillation bars embedded with wavelength-shifting fibers and read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this manuscript the calibration procedures of the SiPMs are described including corrections for the temperature dependence of their light yield. These corrections are needed as the SiPMs are not kept at a constant temperature due to the complexity and cost of implementing a cooling system on such a large detector. Rather, it was decided to monitor the temperature to allow the appropriate corrections to be made. The SiPM temperature dependence has been measured in a dedicated experiment and the calibration procedures were validated with data from production detectors awaiting installation at Fermilab.",
