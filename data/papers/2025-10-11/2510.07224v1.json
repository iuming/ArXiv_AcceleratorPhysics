  "title": "Sextupole reduction via chaos suppression at the National Synchrotron   Light Source II",
  "abstract": "We revisit the nonlinear lattice design approach for the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) storage ring. By suppressing chaos, we identify alternative sextupole configurations to the original design, which relied on the conventional strategy of simultaneously minimizing Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) and Amplitude-Dependent Detuning (ADD). These alternatives achieve comparable performance while requiring fewer sextupoles. A detailed comparison of two representative solutions is presented and supported by experimental validation. Our results show that the dynamic aperture correlates more strongly with global chaos than with individual RDTs, and that the importance of minimizing ADD may have been overstated in earlier design strategies.",
