  "title": "Silicon Wafer Fracture Stress for Tracking Sensors in Particle Physics   Experiments",
  "abstract": "For the construction of the ATLAS Inner Tracker strip detector, silicon strip sensor modules are glued directly onto carbon fibre support structures using a soft silicone gel. During tests at temperatures below \\unit[-35]{$^{\\circ}$C}, several of the sensors were found to crack due to a mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion between polyimide circuit boards with copper metal layers (glued onto the sensor) and the silicon sensor itself. While module assembly procedures were developed to minimise variations between modules, cold tests showed a wide range of temperatures at which supposedly comparable modules failed. The observed variance (fracture temperatures between \\unit[-35]{\\textcelsius} and \\unit[-70]{\\textcelsius}) for supposedly comparable modules suggests an undetected variation between modules suspected to be intrinsic to the silicon wafer itself. Therefore, a test programme was developed to investigate the fracture stress of representative sensor wafer cutoffs. This paper presents results for the fracture stress of silicon sensors used in detector modules.",
