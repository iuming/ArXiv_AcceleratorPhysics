  "title": "Chaotic Motion of Ions In Finite-amplitude Low-frequency Alfv√©n Waves",
  "abstract": "Finite-amplitude low-frequency Alfv\\'en waves (AWs) are commonly found in plasma environments, such as space plasmas, and play a crucial role in ion heating. In this study, we examine the nonlinear interactions between monochromatic AWs and ions. When the wave amplitude and propagation angle lie within certain ranges, particle motion becomes chaotic. We quantify this chaotic behavior using the maximum Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda_m$, and find that chaos depends on the particles' initial states. To characterize the proportion of chaotic particles across different initial states, we introduce the Chaos Ratio ($CR$). The threshold for the onset of global chaos is calculated as the contour line of $CR=0.01$. We analyze changes in the magnetic moment during particle motion and identify the physical image of chaos as pitch-angle scattering caused by wave-induced field line curvature (WFLC). Consequently, the condition for chaos can be expressed as the effective relative curvature radius $P_{eff.}<C$, with $C$ being a constant. We analytically determine the chaos region in the $(k_x,\\,k_z,\\,B_w)$ parameter space, and the results show excellent agreement with the global chaos threshold given by $CR=0.01$.",
