  "title": "Characteristics of electromagnetic radiation and the interference protection on a small-sized direct-acting electron accelerator with a plasma opening switch",
  "abstract": "An experimental study of the parameters of electromagnetic and X-ray radiation was carried out on a small-sized direct-acting electron accelerator with inductive storage and a plasma opening switch. Frequency spectra have been determined, and the diagnostics of the power of the microwave component of the spectrum has been tested. An analytical comparison of radiation signals and power signals has been carried out. A method for determining the directivity pattern using a broadband power sensor has been proposed. An anechoic chamber and a reflective screen were used to suppress interference.",
