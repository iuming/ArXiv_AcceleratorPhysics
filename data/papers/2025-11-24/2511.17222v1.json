  "title": "A Short Introduction to Metal Forming",
  "abstract": "The present paper is a short introduction to metal forming. The paper highlights the different disciplines that should be considered when analyzing metal forming. Hence, mechanical flow, heat flow, mechanical and thermal contact, and microstructure evolution are presented within the perspective of metal forming. For every aspect, well-established knowledge is presented in addition to scientific open questions on which active research is still done.",
