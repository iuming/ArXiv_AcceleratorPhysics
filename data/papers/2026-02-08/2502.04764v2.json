  "title": "Observations of Transition from Imbalanced to Balanced Kinetic Alfvénic Turbulence",
  "abstract": "We report observations of solar wind turbulence derived from measurements by the Parker Solar Probe. Our findings reveal the emergence of finite magnetic helicity within the transition range of the turbulence, aligning with signatures of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs). Notably, as the wave scale transitions from super-ion to sub-ion scales, the ratio of KAWs with opposing signs of magnetic helicity initially increases from approximately 1 to 6.5 before returning to 1. This observation provides, for the first time, compelling evidence for the transition from imbalanced kinetic Alfvénic turbulence to balanced kinetic Alfvénic turbulence.",
