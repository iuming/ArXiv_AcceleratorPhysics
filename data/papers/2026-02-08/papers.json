    "title": "Explosive eruption cycles in a rotating Z-pinch",
    "abstract": "A transonic shear flow directed along magnetic field lines can linearly stabilize a steep pressure gradient in a confined magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma. In Z-pinch geometry, we show that, like the edge pedestal in tokamak devices, this transport barrier -- which we call the ``MHD pedestal'' -- is metastable, i.e., unstable to finite-amplitude displacements of flux tubes. We simulate the slow formation of an MHD pedestal in a heated and sheared Z-pinch, which collapses on reaching a critical height, expelling an order-unity fraction of the confined thermal energy. The MHD pedestal then rebuilds and the process repeats, in a manner analogous to the ELM cycle seen in fusion experiments. We show that the available energy of the metastable equilibrium, and the most energetically favorable amount of ejected plasma, can be calculated from first principles via combinatorial optimization of flux-tube interchanges.",

    "title": "A rapid low-background assay of $^{210}$Pb in archaeological lead",
    "abstract": "In this work, we present a fast and highly efficient method for the measurement of $^{210}$Pb in metallic archaeological lead using the commercial low-background liquid scintillation counter Wallac Quantulus 1220 installed at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy). By combining an optimized chemical preparation with pulse-shape analysis (PSA), the technique achieves sensitivities at the level of a few $10^2$ mBq/kg within one week of measurement, using sample masses below 1 g. The method enables the simultaneous identification of the $β$ decays of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Bi and the $α$ decay of $^{210}$Po, allowing a direct verification of secular equilibrium within the decay chain. With extended acquisition times, detection limits below 100 mBq/kg are reached after approximately 40 days. This approach provides a rapid, accessible, and reliable tool for the radiopurity screening of lead, and is well suited for quality control and R&D activities in next-generation low-background and rare-event physics experiments. Moreover, the method has the potential to be extended to other materials relevant for low-background applications.",

We investigate the overlap reduction function (ORF) of the OLC detector network and analytically derive a transformation that leaves the ORF invariant.

It can map a configuration with small separation and high noise correlation to another configuration with larger separation and reduced noise correlation. Using this transformation, we obtain a favourable OLC detector network configuration with high cross-correlation response, and compare its sensitivity to that of space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors.",

    "title": "Exploring the Design and Measurements of Next-Generation 4H-SiC LGADs",
    "abstract": "This contribution presents the design, production, and initial testing of newly developed 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs). The evaluation includes performance metrics such as the internal gain layer's efficiency in enhancing signal generation. Initial laboratory and Transient Current Technique (TCT) measurements provide insight into the device's stability and response to the signal.   Due to the increase of availability provided by the industry, 4H-SiC is emerging as a strong candidate for the next-generation of semiconductor detectors. Such sensors are promising due to the inherent radiation tolerance of 4H-SiC and its stable operation across a wide temperature range. However, due to the wider-bandgap of 4H-SiC compared to standard silicon, and difficulty to produce high-quality layers thicker than 50 \\textmu m, an internal charge multiplication layer needs to be introduced.   The presented 4H-SiC LGADs, fabricated by onsemi, are optimized for an N-type substrate and epi wafer. The initial TCT and laboratory test results demonstrate fast charge collection and uniform multiplication across multiple samples produced on a single wafer.",

    "title": "Dispersion in nonlinear interferometry: implications for optical coherence tomography with undetected photons",
    "abstract": "Nonlinear SU(1,1) quantum interferometers based on non-degenerate optical parametric down-conversion exhibit strong unbalanced group velocity dispersion (GVD). This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform. The proposed method is compared with an alternative numerical technique. The results demonstrate a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperform the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance.",

    "title": "Characterization of thin optical filters for high purity Cherenkov light readout from scintillating crystals",
    "abstract": "A hybrid dual-readout calorimeter concept, comprising both electromagnetic and hadronic sections, has recently been proposed to meet the performance requirements of experiments at future e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ colliders. The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\\sim 100~\\rm μm$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle. Conversely, two absorptive long-pass filters with cutoff wavelengths around 590~nm were found to block more than 99\\% of the scintillation light from PWO crystals, satisfying the calorimeter specifications.",

    "abstract": "Precise localisation of gamma-ray interactions is crucial for the performance of the Advanced GAmma Tracking Array (AGATA). The Pulse Shape Analysis (PSA) method used for the position estimation of gamma-ray interactions relies on a simulated signal database. The Pulse Shape Comparison Scanning (PSCS) method was used to scan AGATA crystals in order to produce an experimental database of signals. This paper presents a novel approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to determine the 3D interaction position of gamma rays within AGATA crystals, trained on data from IPHC Strasbourg, allowing for the construction of an experimental database. A custom masked loss function is introduced to enable training with incomplete position information. The database generated by this new method outperforms the existing simulated database, and the experimental database obtained from the conventional PSCS algorithm.",

    "abstract": "A study of neural network architectures for the reconstruction of the energy deposited in the cells of the ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeters under high pile-up conditions expected at the HL-LHC is presented. These networks are designed to run on the FPGA-based readout hardware of the calorimeters under strict size and latency constraints. Several architectures, including Dense, Recurrent (RNN), and Convolutional (CNN) neural networks, are optimised using a Bayesian procedure that balances energy resolution against network size. The optimised Dense, CNN, and combined Dense+RNN architectures achieve a transverse energy resolution of approximately 80 MeV, outperforming both the optimal filtering (OF) method currently in use and RNNs of similar complexity. A detailed comparison across the full dynamic range shows that Dense, CNN, and Dense+RNN accurately reproduce the energy scale, while OF and RNNs underestimate the energy. Deep Evidential Regression is implemented within the Dense architecture to address the need for reliable per-event energy uncertainties. This approach provides predictive uncertainty estimates with minimal increase in network size. The predicted uncertainty is found to be consistent, on average, with the difference between the true deposited energy and the predicted energy.",

    "title": "Optimizing the interaction geometry of inverse Compton scattering x-ray sources",
    "abstract": "Inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is a promising method for generating coherent and tunable x-rays in a compact setup. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework describing the output of an ICS x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between pulsed electron and laser beams. This allows for analytic optimization of the x-ray beam properties by varying the parameters defining the geometry. In general, different x-ray applications require optimization of different x-ray beam properties, such as energy spread for x-ray spectroscopy and angular spread for x-ray scattering measurements. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to optimization of the x-ray brilliance, which is a comprehensive figure of merit for x-ray beam quality. We investigate two specific ICS interaction geometries in particular: head-on scattering of a laser beam off an electron beam; and scattering of a laser beam off an electron beam in a co-propagating geometry, interacting under a grazing angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tightly focused, cylindrically symmetric laser pulse, which balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a co-propagating, grazing angle geometry, an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate the effect of a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetospheric twists, that is magnetospheres with a toroidal component, are under scrutiny due to the key role the twist is believed to play in the behaviour of neutron stars. Notably, its dissipation is believed to power magnetar activity, and is an important element of the evolution of these stars. We exhibit a new class of twisted axi-symmetric force-free magnetospheric solutions. We solve the Grad-Shafranov equation by introducing an ansatz akin to a multipolar expansion. We obtain a hierarchical system of ordinary differential equations where lower-order multipoles source the higher-order ones. We show that analytical approximations can be obtained, and that in general solutions can be numerically computed using standard ODE solvers. We obtain a class of solutions with a great flexibility in initial conditions, and show that a subset of these asymptotically tend to vacuum. The twist is not confined to a subset of field lines. The solutions are symmetric about the equator, with a toroidal component that can be reversed. This symmetry is supported by an equatorial current sheet. We provide a first-order approximation of a particular solution that consists in the superposition of a vacuum dipole and a toroidal magnetic field sourced by the dipole, where the toroidal component decays as $1/r^4$. As an example of strongly multipolar solution, we also exhibit cases with an additional octupole component.",

    "title": "Physics-Informed Neural Compression of High-Dimensional Plasma Data",
    "abstract": "High-fidelity scientific simulations are now producing unprecedented amounts of data, creating a storage and analysis bottleneck. A single simulation can generate tremendous data volumes, often forcing researchers to discard valuable information. A prime example of this is plasma turbulence described by the gyrokinetic equations: nonlinear, multiscale, and 5D in phase space. It constitutes one of the most computationally demanding frontiers of modern science, with runs taking weeks and yielding tens of terabytes of data dumps. The increasing storage demands underscore the importance of compression. However, reconstructed snapshots do not necessarily preserve essential physical quantities. We present a spatiotemporal evaluation pipeline, accounting for structural phenomena and multi-scale transient fluctuations to assess the degree of physical fidelity. Indeed, we find that various compression techniques lack preservation of both spatial mode structure and temporal turbulence characteristics. Therefore, we explore Physics-Informed Neural Compression (PINC), which incorporates physics-informed losses tailored to gyrokinetics and enables extreme compressions ratios of over 70,000x. Entropy coding on top of PINC further pushes it to 120,000x. This direction provides a viable and scalable solution to the prohibitive storage demands of gyrokinetics, enabling post-hoc analyses that were previously infeasible.",

    "title": "The Correlation Length of Turbulence in Magnetic Clouds",
    "abstract": "The large-scale limit or outer scale of turbulence in the solar wind is associated with the correlation length of the magnetic field. Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed. Finally, we discuss the possible relation of turbulence correlation lengths to mesoscale structure in magnetic clouds.",

    "title": "Self ordering to imposed ordering of dust -- a continuous spatial phase transition experiment in MDPX",
    "abstract": "Previous experiments conducted in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX) revealed an intriguing phenomenon first referred to as imposed ordering. This occurs when micron-sized dust particles become aligned with the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above the dust (at a distance much larger than the plasma Debye length or the ion-neutral or electron-neutral mean free paths) in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the mesh. In this work, results of a transition experiment are presented wherein starting from a classical two-dimensional Coulomb crystal with hexagonal symmetry in an unmagnetized plasma $(B = 0\\,T)$, dust transitions to a state in which it flows along the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above it, mapping out the 4-fold symmetry of the boundary condition. It is hypothesized that beyond a certain magnetization, elongated electric potential structures emanating from the mesh drive the dust motion to reflect the mesh morphology, transitioning from a 6-fold self ordering to 4-fold imposed ordering. The various dust phases are quantified and a critical value of magnetic field is identified in the transition experiment indicating the onset of imposed ordering.",

    "abstract": "The nonlinear development of ballooning instability and the subsequently induced plasmoid formation in the near-Earth magnetotail demonstrated in MHD simulations has been proposed as a potential trigger mechanism for substorm onset over the past decade, and their connections to the in-situ satellite and ground all-sky auroral optical observations have been a subject of continued research. In this work, a set of THEMIS substorm onset events with good conjunction of auroral observations has been selected for comparative simulation study, whose pre-onset magnetotail configuration and conditions are inferred from in-situ data and compared with the onset conditions of ballooning instability obtained in our MHD simulations. The evolution of the near-Earth magnetotail is followed, where the signatures of ballooning instability and the plasmoid formation are extracted from simulations and compared with the magnetic fields and flow patterns within the magnetotail region from observation data. The field-aligned current (FAC) density is evaluated at the Earth side boundary of the magnetotail domain of simulation, which is further mapped along magnetic field lines to the auroral ionosphere and compared with the auroral pattern and evolution there in terms of growth rate, dominant wavenumber, and absolute auroral intensities. Such validation efforts are also the first step towards the development of a self-consistent coupling model that includes the magnetotail-ionosphere interaction in the substorm onset process.",

    "title": "Numerical model for pellet rocket acceleration in PELOTON",
    "abstract": "A direct numerical simulation model for the rocket acceleration of pellets in thermonuclear fusion devices has been developed for PELOTON, a 3D Lagrangian particle pellet code [R. Samulyak et al, Nuclear Fusion 61 (4), 046007 (2021)], and validated using shattered pellet injection (SPI) experiments in JET. The pellet rocket acceleration is driven by grad-B drift of the ablation cloud that creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the cloud. The model accounts for non-uniform charging of the ablation cloud by hot plasma electrons as well as local plasma gradients. The increased pressure on the high-field-side compared to the low-field-side leads to pellet (fragment) rocket acceleration. Pure deuterium and deuterium-neon mixture models have been implemented. The background plasma states have been obtained by using a new plasma cooling model for PELOTON. The cooling model distributes the ablated material within the corresponding flux volumes and accounts for ionization and other energy losses, Ohmic heating by toroidal currents, and the energy exchange between ions and electrons. Plasma profiles predicted by PELOTON cooling model have been compared with JOREK and INDEX simulations. PELOTON simulations of rocket acceleration and the corresponding trajectories of deuterium fragments are consistent with experimentally measured trajectories in JET. We show that composite deuterium-neon pellets containing 0.5% of neon experienced smaller deviation of their trajectories compared to the pure deuterium case. We simulate various spatial configurations of pellet fragments and demonstrate the cloud overlap impact on rocket acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of plasma state gradients on the rocket acceleration. Future work will focus on the rocket acceleration of SPI in projected ITER plasmas and the development of the corresponding scaling law for the rocket acceleration.",

    "abstract": "The TRISTAN detector is an upgrade to the KATRIN experiment to enable a differential measurement of the tritium $β$-decay spectrum to search for the experimental signature of keV scale sterile neutrinos. The TRISTAN detector upgrade consists of performing precision electron spectroscopy with over 1000 silicon drift detector pixels, each responsible for recording event rates of $10^5$ counts per second. A project specific data acquisition (DAQ) system is developed to meet the experimental challenges with a remote analog to digital conversion (RADC) design. In this work, the conceptual design of the RADC DAQ is presented along with the built system for operating the TRISTAN detector upgrade. The system includes flexible signal processing logic and data management that is optimized for the high-rate precision measurement. The non-linearity of the system's readout channels are measured and shown to be stable over time. The systematic effect of this non-linearity is propagated to the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino signature and is demonstrated to be reducible to a subdominant contribution.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.",

    "title": "Exploring the keV-scale physics potential of CUORE",
    "abstract": "We present the analysis techniques developed to explore the keV-scale energy region of the CUORE experiment, based on more than 2 tonne yr of data collected over 5 years. By prioritizing a stricter selection over a larger exposure, we are able to optimize data selection for thresholds at 10 keV and 3 keV with 691 kg yr and 11 kg yr of data, respectively. We study how the performance varies among the 988-detector array with different detector characteristics and data taking conditions. We achieve an average baseline resolution of 2.54 $\\pm$ 0.14 keV FWHM and 1.18 $\\pm$ 0.02 keV FWHM for the data selection at 10 keV and 3 keV, respectively. The analysis methods employed reduce the overall background by about an order of magnitude, reaching 2.06 $\\pm$ 0.05 counts/(keV kg days) and 16 $\\pm$ 2 counts/(keV kg days) at the thresholds of 10 keV and 3 keV. We evaluate for the first time the near-threshold reconstruction efficiencies of the CUORE experiment, and find these to be 26 $\\pm$ 4 \\% and 50 $\\pm$ 2 \\% at 3 keV and 10 keV, respectively. This analysis provides crucial insights into rare decay studies, new physics searches, and keV-scale background modeling with CUORE. We demonstrate that tonne-scale cryogenic calorimeters can operate across a wide energy range, from keV to MeV, establishing their scalability as versatile detectors for rare event and dark matter physics. These findings also inform the optimization of future large mass cryogenic calorimeters to enhance the sensitivity to low-energy phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Warm Dense Matter lies at the frontier between condensed matter and plasma, and plays a central role in various fields ranging from planetary science to inertial confinement fusion. Improving our understanding of this regime requires experimental data that can be directly compared with theoretical and numerical models over a broad range of conditions. In this work, a pulsed-power experiment is described in which thin metallic foils, confined within a sapphire cell, are Joule-heated to achieve the expanded warm dense matter regime. Designing such an experiment is challenging, as it requires simultaneously predicting the electrical response of the pulsed-power driver and the hydrodynamic evolution of the heated material. To tackle this challenge, a modeling framework has been developed that couples an electrical description of the pulsed-power system, including the driver, the switching stages and the load with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code. This coupling allows the electrical energy deposition and the load thermodynamic evolution to be consistently linked through the material electrical conductivity. This approach takes advantage of the simplicity of a 1D geometry while retaining the essential physics and allowing to reproduce various measurements with good accuracy, such as expansion velocity, current and voltage. This numerical approach therefore constitutes a robust and efficient method for designing and optimizing future Warm Dense Matter experiments using pulsed-power facilities.",

    "title": "Nonlinear Saturation of the Acoustic Resonant Drag Instability",
    "abstract": "Resonant drag instabilities (RDIs) are a novel type of dust/fluid instability relevant to a diverse range of astrophysical environments. They are driven by a resonant interaction between streaming dust and waves in a background medium, which results in dust density fluctuations and amplification of the waves. This broad class of instabilities includes recently-proposed modes incorporating acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, as well as the well-studied disk streaming instability. As the study of RDIs is at an early stage, their evolution beyond the linear regime is not well understood. In order to make inroads into the nonlinear theory of RDIs, we performed simulations of the simplest case, the acoustic RDI, in which sound waves in a gas are amplified by interaction with supersonically streaming dust. This particular instability is of interest both due its potential relevance in various poorly ionized environments, and due to its resemblance to the fast magnetosonic RDI. We find that the nonlinear growth and saturation of the instability are characterized by a balance between time scales of instability growth and turbulent eddy turnover. The simulations demonstrate a saturated state possessing an anisotropic outer forcing range in which this balance is maintained, and suggest the presence of an isotropic turbulent inertial range below this scale. By presenting a model for the nonlinear growth and saturated state of the acoustic RDI, this work provides a framework for further study of the nonlinear behavior of this and other RDIs.",

    "abstract": "We study the density modulation of an interacting Fermi gas caused by the uniform motion of an impurity at zero temperature. For strong enough interaction among Fermi atoms, the modulation propagates thanks to the excitation of the collective zero sound mode if the impurity speed is above the zero sound threshold. We are able to assess, via a semi-analytic evaluation, the extent of the zero sound contribution to the density oscillation over and above the incoherent background of particle-hole excitations. Given the strong dependence of the results on the features of the gas interaction potential, we also analyze how they vary depending on its strength, range and shape.",

    "abstract": "We present a statistical mechanics framework for modeling non-equilibrium transport coefficients using the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE). We show that the kernel, obtained via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) from the stochastic force autocorrelation measured in a thermal equilibrium state, is sufficient to model the dynamics of the system in a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS). This approach provides a computationally efficient path to modeling complex transport problems. We apply this framework to the canonical problem of test particle drag in a uniform plasma. The GLE formalism is shown to naturally capture non-Markovian phenomena through the moments of the kernel, including an effective mass renormalization and oscillatory relaxation. We demonstrate that the standard Chandrasekhar stopping power formula arises naturally as the Markovian limit of this equilibrium memory kernel. These theoretical predictions are quantitatively validated by direct Particle-in-Cell simulations, which confirm the predicted oscillatory structure of the memory kernel. This work thus establishes a practical method for predicting non-equilibrium transport properties from first-principles equilibrium simulations.",

The setup excites the sample with a laser and acquires a spectrum at each spatial coordinate in a raster scan pattern. A double-acquisition method is used to remove cosmic ray artifacts by comparing subsequent measurements at the same spatial coordinate. Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission. The system integrates Python-based hardware control for motorized stages, spectrometer acquisition, and post-processing, with a migration to a galvo-mirror scanning approach for using it along with a cryostat for low temperature measurements. Our results demonstrate spatially resolved PL maps and temperature-dependent spectra, highlighting the capability of the setup to efficiently benchmark SPE performance. We further went on to perform automation of other experiments such as a Non-Linear Interferometry setup for Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and a Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy using a common path birefringence Interferometer to obtain hyperspectral images of our samples.",

    "title": "Data sorting modes of phoswich detector array",
    "abstract": "The different data-sorting modes of the phoswich detector array PARIS used for detecting high-energy (4$-$10 MeV) $γ$ rays are investigated. The characteristics including time resolution, energy resolution and detection efficiency under various modes are studied. The present study shows that PARIS has capabilities of rejecting escape and pileup events when used for decay spectroscopy. Notably, the methods presented in this work refer specifically to the $β$-decay experiment of $^{80g+m}$Ga conducted with three PARIS clusters comprising 27 phoswich detectors, rather than to a general report on the PARIS array or its overall performance for in-beam spectroscopy. Compared with the 2\"$\\times$2\"$\\times$2\" LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector (Ciemała et al., 2009), even in individual mode, PARIS provides significant suppression of single- and double-escape peaks and reduces background via vetoing function of the outer-volume NaI(Tl) crystals. In contrast to the common approach of adding back the energies in LaBr$_3$(Ce) and NaI(Tl) to increase the detection efficiency of the full-energy peak, using NaI(Tl) as a veto shield provides a superior trade-off for applications where spectral purity is essential. Employing add-back analysis within each cluster of nine phoswiches or between all phoswiches could enhance full-energy peak efficiency and further suppress escape peaks and background. Applying a multiplicity condition provides a further suppression but simultaneously lowers the statistics of full-energy peaks.",

The muons were generated following the interaction of a GeV-scale high-charge electron beam with a 2cm-thick Pb target and were detected using a Timepix3 detector placed behind a suitable shielding configuration. Data analysis indicates a $(99.1\\pm0.5)$% confidence of muon detection over noise, in excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Extrapolation of the experimental setup to higher electron energies and charges suggests the potential to guide and separate from noise approximately $10^4$ muons/s onto cm$^2$-scale areas for applications using a 10 Hz PW laser. These results demonstrate the possibility of generating and transporting directional muon beams using high-power lasers and establish a foundation for the systematic application of laser-driven high-energy muon beams.",

    "abstract": "Ultrafast mid-infrared (MIR) imaging is a key enabling capability for monitoring transient thermal and plasma phenomena in scientific diagnostics and industrial safety. However, conventional cryogenic MIR cameras face a fundamental trade-off between frame rate, noise, and pixel format. Here we report a passive, incoherent MIR imaging platform that leverages sum-frequency upconversion in chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPLN) to translate broadband 3--5um scenes to the near-infrared, enabling ultrafast acquisition on a silicon-based intensified CCD (iCCD). In fast-kinetics mode we achieve a physical frame rate of 100kHz with microsecond-scale gate control, and we directly capture the full evolution of an air-breakdown electric arc, resolving its rapid ignition, expansion, and decay dynamics. Beyond demonstrating ultrafast passive imaging, we introduce a drift-aware calibration workflow based on Allan deviation analysis to quantitatively select the gate width and averaging strategy under realistic slow-drift and multiplicative noise. This combined capability -- ultrafast passive MIR imaging plus operationally meaningful calibration -- provides a practical route toward real-time thermal surveillance and early-warning systems for hazardous fast transients.",

    "abstract": "The search for light dark matter and cosmic primordial neutrinos necessitates detectors with sub-millielectronvolt (sub-meV) energy thresholds. While superconducting quantum sensors have approached this sensitivity, they often face significant challenges regarding readout complexity and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid Superconductor-Insulator-P-N (S-I-P-N) detector architecture. This concept combines the high sensitivity of superconducting Cooper pair breaking with the massive intrinsic gain of semiconductor electron avalanches. A critical prerequisite for this scheme is operation at millikelvin (mK) temperatures, raising the critical fundamental question of whether silicon PN junctions can sustain avalanche multiplication in a regime where carrier freeze-out is severe. Here, we experimentally validate the critical semiconductor amplification stage of the proposed detector. We demonstrate that Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) retain robust Geiger-mode avalanche capabilities at 10 mK. We report a single-photoelectron gain of order 10$^6$ and a dark count rate as low as 5~mHz/mm$^2$, 7 orders of magnitude lower than at room temperature. These results confirm the viability of high-gain semiconductor readout in the deep cryogenic regime, clearing the primary obstacle regarding the semiconductor component for the realization of scalable, sub-meV threshold S-I-P-N detectors.",

    "abstract": "This study reexamines the excitation of ion-acoustic precursor solitons by a supersonically moving charged debris object, incorporating two previously overlooked physical factors: the dynamic charging of the debris and the impermeable nature of its surface. The influence of charging dynamics is explored using an enhanced one-dimensional fluid-Poisson model, where the source charge is treated as a dynamical variable and solved self-consistently alongside the core plasma equations. By comparing these results with prior fixed-charge models, we evaluate the effects on soliton onset and propagation, finding that charging dynamics does not hinder soliton generation or evolution. To assess the impact of the impermeability of debris surface, a two-dimensional fluid model simulates the interaction between an electrostatically biased, impenetrable object and a flowing plasma. Modeling the object as an infinite wall disconnects the upstream and downstream plasma regions, forming a sheath without solitons -- consistent with earlier fluid and particle-in-cell simulations. However, replacing the wall with a finite object enables plasma flow around it, restoring upstream-downstream connectivity and naturally generating precursor solitons.",

We introduce a generative framework, called JointDiff, which enables predictions of conditional simulation input and output distributions from partial, multi-modal observations. The model leverages joint diffusion to unify forward surrogate modeling, inverse inference, and output imputation into one architecture. We train our model on a large ensemble of three-dimensional Multi-Rocket Piston simulations and demonstrate high accuracy, statistical robustness, and transferability to experiments performed at the National Ignition Facility (NIF).

Several annealing conditions were investigated to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn film. The best co-sputtered Nb-Sn film was achieved after annealing at 600 C for 6 h, followed by annealing at 950 C for 1 h. The best process was applied to a Nb cavity, which was RF tested in a cryogenic dewar. RF testing of the Nb3Sn-coated cavity demonstrated a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) close to the highest reported, at 17.78 K. The Nb3Sn cavity underwent a light Sn recoating process, followed by additional RF testing, resulting in enhancement of the RF performance, primarily due to improved surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn coating.",

    "title": "ATLAS MDT TDC Simulations for LHC Run3 and HL-LHC",
    "abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) started the Run 3 operation in 2022, and the peak instantaneous luminosity in Run 3 may reach 3 x 10^34 cm-2s-1. The ATLAS Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers are the main component of the precision tracking system in the ATLAS muon spectrometer. It is important to understand any potential issues with the MDT Front-End (FE) readout electronics for an expected level-1 (L1) trigger rate of 100 kHz and a complex deadtime of over 5% for Run 3 operations. We use raw data collected in 2022 to emulate the expected hit rates in MDT chambers and perform a realistic simulation on the ATLAS Muon TDC (Time-to-Digital Converter) (AMT) chip with the current configuration. We study the AMT chip performances by analyzing the trigger/L1/readout buffer occupancies and hit loss fractions under different luminosities with L1 rate of 100 kHz by using the Modelsim software. The hit loss fraction of the hottest MDT chamber (BIL3C05) is lower than 5% due to FE readout, even at a luminosity of 5.01 x 10^34 cm-2s-1 with a deadtime of 5% and a L1 rate of 100 kHz, indicating that AMT can operate under Run 3 conditions without problems. The MDT trigger and readout electronics will be replaced for triggerless readout during High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) runs. We also simulate the AMT behavior in the triggerless mode up to 7.44 x 10^34 cm-2s-1 and propose possible AMT configurations in case some FE electronics could not be replaced during the long shutdown 3 (LS3).",

    "title": "A High-order piecewise field-aligned triangular finite element method for electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle simulations of tokamak plasmas with open field lines",
    "abstract": "A high-order piecewise field-aligned triangular finite element method is developed and implemented for global electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle-in-cell simulations of tokamak plasmas with open field lines. The approach combines locally field-aligned finite element basis functions with unstructured $C^{1}$ triangular meshes in cylindrical coordinates, enabling whole-volume simulations with substantially reduced computational effort, while avoiding the grid distortion associated with globally field-aligned coordinates and the associated singularity at the separatrix of diverted plasmas. The formulation is compatible with both $δf$ and full-$f$ models and employs mixed-variable representations, along with a generalized pullback scheme, to control numerical cancellation in electromagnetic simulations. The method is implemented in the TRIMEG-C1 code and demonstrated using linear and nonlinear electromagnetic simulations of the TCV-X21 configuration. The results indicate that the approach accurately captures the key features of electromagnetic ion-temperature-gradient and kinetic ballooning mode physics, including the separatrix regions in the simulation, thereby providing a robust framework for whole-volume electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations in realistic tokamak geometries.",

    "title": "A numerical study on plasma acceleration processes with ion dynamics at the sub-nanosecond timescale",
    "abstract": "Plasma wakefield acceleration is a groundbreaking technique for accelerating particles, capable of sustaining gigavolt-per-meter accelerating fields. Understanding the physical mechanisms governing the recovery of plasma accelerating properties over time is essential for successfully achieving high-repetition-rate plasma acceleration, a key requirement for applicability in both research and commercial settings. In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the early-stage plasma evolution based on the parameters of the SPARC_LAB hydrogen plasma recovery time experiment (Pompili et al., Comm. Phys. 7, 241 (2024)), employing spatially resolved Particle-in-Cell and fluid models. The experiment reports on a non-monotonic dependence of the plasma recovery time on the initial plasma density, an effect for which ion motion has been invoked as a contributing factor. The simulations presented here provide further insight into the role of ion dynamics in shaping this behavior. Furthermore, comparing Particle-in-Cell and fluid approaches allows us to assess the quality of fluid models for describing this class of plasma dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We report the fabrication and characterization of two p-type inverted coaxial point contact (ICPC) high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, SAP16 and SAP17, produced from USD-grown crystals with net impurity concentrations of $\\sim 3\\times10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Both devices employ \\emph{thin} amorphous-germanium (a-Ge) dual-blocking contacts, implemented here for the first time on ICPC detectors, to provide bipolar charge blocking while limiting dead-layer thickness. Electrical tests at 76~K demonstrate stable operation with picoampere-level leakage currents and sub-pF capacitance: SAP17 reached $\\sim 4.62$~pA at the maximum tested bias (500~V) and operated stably at 400~V with $C\\simeq 0.503$~pF. \\emph{Meanwhile,} SAP16 achieved superior spectroscopic performance, with energy resolutions of 2.42\\% at 59.5~keV and 0.36\\% at 662~keV. Gamma-ray spectroscopy with $^{241}$Am and $^{137}$Cs shows that modest geometric differences lead to measurable changes in depletion behavior and charge-collection uniformity, consistent with electrostatic modeling. Angular-response measurements further reveal pronounced directional sensitivity at 59.5~keV, whereas the 662~keV response is essentially isotropic over the measured range. These results validate thin a-Ge dual-blocking contacts for ICPC HPGe detectors and highlight geometry-driven trade-offs among leakage current, depletion, and energy resolution relevant to low-background and low-threshold applications.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive characterization of laser-produced tin (Sn) plasmas relevant to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography using a multi-diagnostic suite integrated into the new experimental platform, \"SparkLight\". Tin plasmas are generated by irradiating a continuously moving tin-coated wire with laser pulses (1064 nm, 10 ns, up to $5.7\\times10^{10}$ W/cm$^2$) and probed via coherent Thomson scattering, laser interferometry, and EUV emission spectroscopy. Thomson scattering measurements reveal electron temperatures and densities that decay with distance from the target. Densities derived from Thomson scattering are cross-validated against laser interferometry, showing excellent agreement. Correlating the results of these laser diagnostics with spatially resolved EUV spectroscopy suggests that the bulk of useful EUV emission originates within 150 $μ$m of the target and is generated under suboptimal plasma conditions. This work demonstrates a practical integrated approach for plasma characterization in EUV source development.",

    "abstract": "We derive the hot-electron-limit (HEL) closure for the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, known as the gyromoment (GM) approach. By expanding the gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio limit, τ = Ti/Te << 1, and retaining only the essential O(τ) terms, we obtain a closed system for the density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In a Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with the HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low collisionality dynamics. An extension to the tokamak-relevant s-α geometry and a comparison with gyrokinetic simulations reveal the capabilities and limitations of the HEL-closed GM model: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at τ=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents an accurate prediction of the Dimits shift and of transport suppression.",

    "title": "Towards fully predictive gyrokinetic full-f simulations: validation and triangularity studies in TCV",
    "abstract": "Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \\times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.",

    "abstract": "Collisionless Larmor coupling is a fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that enables momentum transfer between an expanding plasma and a magnetized ambient medium. In this paper, we report on the laboratory experimental study of Larmor coupling leading to the formation of a plasma blob associated with a laser-driven, super-Alfvénic plasma flow on the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. The high-repetition rate enables systematic spatial and temporal scans of the plasma evolution using Doppler spectroscopy, as well as measurements of the magnetic field, electrostatic field, and self-emission of both debris and ambient ions using filtered imaging. We observe the self-focusing of the laser-produced plasma and the formation of a secondary diamagnetic cavity associated with a blob composed of background ions. Doppler spectroscopy reveals the transverse velocity distribution of the background ions, providing direct evidence of ion energization via Larmor coupling. The systematic spatial and temporal scans enabled by the high-repetition rate experiment allow for a detailed characterization of the ion dynamics. These experimental observations are supported by numerical simulations that provide more insight into the kinetic-scale physics associated with blob formation as well as the role of the ambient plasma density.",
