  "title": "The Methodology and Implementation of a Real Time Monitoring System for Cryogenic Fridges",
  "abstract": "Inspired by the dilution refrigerator and magnet monitoring system developed for HAYSTAC at Yale University, Speller Lab at Johns Hopkins University developed the Fridge Real Time Monitoring System (FRTMS). The FRTMS accesses logs saved locally by the dilution refrigerator, saves these logs to various backup locations, edits the logs into a format for upload to a MySQL database, and allows the logs to be remotely monitored in near-real time.",
