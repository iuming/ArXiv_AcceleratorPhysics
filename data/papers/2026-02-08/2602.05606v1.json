  "title": "An approximate Kappa generator for particle simulations",
  "abstract": "A random number generator for the Kappa velocity distribution in particle simulations is proposed. Approximating the cumulative distribution function with the q-exponential function, an inverse transform procedure is constructed. The proposed method provides practically accurate results, in particular for k<4. It runs fast on graphics processing units (GPUs). The derivation, numerical validation, and relevance to GPU execution models are discussed.",
