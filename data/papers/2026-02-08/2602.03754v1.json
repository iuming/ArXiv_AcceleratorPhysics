  "title": "A numerical study on plasma acceleration processes with ion dynamics at the sub-nanosecond timescale",
  "abstract": "Plasma wakefield acceleration is a groundbreaking technique for accelerating particles, capable of sustaining gigavolt-per-meter accelerating fields. Understanding the physical mechanisms governing the recovery of plasma accelerating properties over time is essential for successfully achieving high-repetition-rate plasma acceleration, a key requirement for applicability in both research and commercial settings. In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the early-stage plasma evolution based on the parameters of the SPARC_LAB hydrogen plasma recovery time experiment (Pompili et al., Comm. Phys. 7, 241 (2024)), employing spatially resolved Particle-in-Cell and fluid models. The experiment reports on a non-monotonic dependence of the plasma recovery time on the initial plasma density, an effect for which ion motion has been invoked as a contributing factor. The simulations presented here provide further insight into the role of ion dynamics in shaping this behavior. Furthermore, comparing Particle-in-Cell and fluid approaches allows us to assess the quality of fluid models for describing this class of plasma dynamics.",
