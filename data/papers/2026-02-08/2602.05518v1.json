  "title": "Three-Dimensional Spiral Beam Injection:Design Principles and Experimental Verification",
  "abstract": "A proof of principle experiment of Three-dimensional spiral beam injection scheme has been carried out. This injection scheme requires a strongly x-y coupled beam to meet magnetic field distribution through solenoid magnet fringe field. In this paper, we introduce outline of experimental setup, results of x-y coupling adjustment with DC electron beam of 80 keV. The results of this experiment will be evaluated and improvements for actual operation will be discussed.",
