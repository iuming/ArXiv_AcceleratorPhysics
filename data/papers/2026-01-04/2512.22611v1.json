  "title": "Impact of fast ions on turbulent transport in high-\\b{eta} HL-2A scenarios",
  "abstract": "The fast-ion (FI) on turbulent transport is one of the key topics of magnetic confinement fusion. This work focus on the impact of FI pressure gradients on turbulence in a high-\\b{eta} plasma scenario using gyrokinetic simulations. Linear analyses reveal that FIs strongly stabilize ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes via the thermal-ion dilution, while their influence on trapped electron modes (TEMs) is minimal. At elevated FI pressure gradients, a transition to a FI-driven BAE (FI-BAE) regime occurs, as evidenced by mode structure and frequency alignment within the Alfvénic gap. Electron \\b{eta} scans further demonstrate the emergence of kinetic ballooning modes (KBMs) at higher \\b{eta}, whereas an ITG-TEM hybrid turbulence dominates near experimental \\b{eta} values. Nonlinear simulations show that moderate FI pressure suppresses transport via zonal flow (ZF) shear, whereas strong FI drive weakens ZFs and enhances transport by destabilizing FI-BAEs. These results highlight the dual role of FIs in regulating turbulence and offer insight into multiscale transport physics relevant for high-performance plasmas.",
