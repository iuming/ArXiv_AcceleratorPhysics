  "title": "The role of particle feedback on particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection",
  "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process in astrophysical plasmas and an efficient mechanism for particle acceleration. Using 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with a co-evolving fluid-particle framework, we investigate how particle feedback affects reconnection and acceleration. Our simulations demonstrate that particle feedback to the fluid amplifies shear flows within magnetic islands, which strengthens the convective electric field and thereby boosts particle acceleration. This mechanism results in a higher maximum particle energy and a harder non-thermal energy spectrum. The guide field suppresses both the increase in gas internal energy and particle acceleration. These findings highlight the complex interplay between feedback, guide fields, and reconnection dynamics.",
