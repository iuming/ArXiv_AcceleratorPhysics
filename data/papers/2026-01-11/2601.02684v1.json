  "title": "RONS Generation in Plasma-Activated Saline for Wound Healing",
  "abstract": "This study explores the physicochemical modifications and antimicrobial potential of plasma activated saline generated by exposing Sodium Chloride and Ringer solution to atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge plasma. Plasma activation produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species leading to changes in pH, redox potential, conductivity and concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide, Nitrogen and Nitrous Oxides. Effects of activation time, voltage, and gas composition were analyzed. Antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E coli was assessed via MIC, CFU reduction and biofilm inhibition tests. Optimal plasma exposure achieved strong microbial inactivation with good biocompatibility. SEM and FTIR confirmed membrane damage, supporting PAS as a safe, nonantibiotic wound irrigation and disinfectant solution.",
