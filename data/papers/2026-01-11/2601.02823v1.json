  "title": "Development of CMOS LGAD sensors for the ALICE~3 Time of Flight detector",
  "abstract": "The next-generation ALICE 3 experiment at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) requires detector technologies that combine fine spatial resolution, fast timing, and an extremely low material budget. This paper presents the design, characterization, and beam-test performance of MadPix, a monolithic CMOS sensor featuring an internal avalanche gain layer. The sensor is implemented in a 110 nm CMOS imaging process and demonstrates the portability of the Low Gain Avalanche Diode concept to a standard CMOS technology. The results showed an intrinsic gain between 10 and 13 and a time resolution of 75 ps.",
