  "title": "Plasma Confinement State Classification via FPP Relevant Microwave   Diagnostics",
  "abstract": "We present a parsimonious and robust machine learning approach for identifying plasma confinement states in fusion power plants (FPPs) where reliable identification of the low-confinement (L-mode) and high-confinement (H-mode) regimes is critical for safe and efficient operation. Unlike research-oriented devices, FPPs must operate with a severely constrained set of diagnostics. To address this challenge, we demonstrate that a minimalist model, using only electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals, can deliver accurate and reliable state classification. ECE provides electron temperature profiles without the engineering or survivability issues of in-vessel probes, making it a primary candidate for FPP-relevant diagnostics. Our framework employs ECE as input, extracts features with radial basis functions, and applies a gradient boosting classifier, achieving high accuracy with test accuracy averaging 96\\% correct predictions. Robustness analysis and feature importance study confirm the reliability of the approach. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art performance is attainable from a restricted diagnostic set, paving the way for minimalist yet resilient plasma control architectures for FPPs.",
