  "title": "Introduction to Optics Design",
  "abstract": "This lecture provides an overview of the principles and methodologies involved in linear optics design. It aims to introduce key concepts such as the matrix formalism, the symplecticity, the quantities that are preserved in the single particle evolution, e.g., the Courant-Snyder invariant. It also covers the concept of beam emittance and matching conditions for an ensemble of particles. The goal is to equip readers with the foundational tools needed for both theoretical understanding and practical application in linear optics and accelerator design.",
