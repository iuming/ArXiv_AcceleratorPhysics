  "title": "High-brightness Graphite Photocathodes",
  "abstract": "A robust and infrared laser-excited photocathode with high quantum efficiency, high brightness, and low cost, operating under a moderate vacuum, has long been sought by the accelerator and microscopy communities. This study investigates various types of graphite photocathodes, including bulk, sheet, and flake graphite, in the regime of thermionically assisted photoemission by an irradiating infrared laser. Our experiment reveals that, under space-charge-limited photoemission, the flake-graphite photocathode with a dense population of nano-graphene fins on its surface exhibits the highest quantum efficiency, which is 770 times greater than that of a copper photocathode irradiated by the same infrared laser at 1064 nm. With our theory considering both thermionic and multiphoton emissions, we determine that the flake graphite photocathode is 200 times brighter than a copper photocathode irradiated by an infrared laser and is as bright as a LaB6 field emitter.",
